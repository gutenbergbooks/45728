  <h2 class='c002'>CHAPTER I<br /> <br />A YOUNG MAN’S FANCY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Come on, old man.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence led the way with a jaunty step that
was intended to show his easy footing with the
Carters. But Marley lagged behind. Even if calling
on girls had not been such a serious business
with him, he could not forget that he was just graduated
from college and that a certain dignity befitted
him. He wished Lawrence would not speak so
loud; the girls might hear, and think he was
afraid; he wished to keep the truth from them as
long as possible. He had already caught a glimpse
of the girls, or thought he had, but before he could
make sure, the vague white figures on the veranda
stirred; he heard a scurrying, and the loose bang
of a screen door. Then it was still. Lawrence
laughed—somehow, as Marley felt, derisively.</p>

<p class='c003'>The way from the sidewalk up to the Carters’
veranda was not long, of course, though it seemed
long to Marley, and Marley’s deliberation made
it seem long to Lawrence. They paused at the
steps of the veranda, and Lawrence made a low
bow.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Good evening, Mrs. Carter,” he said. “Ah,
Captain, you here too?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley had not noticed the captain, or Mrs.
Carter; they sat there so quietly, enjoying the
cool of the evening, or such cool as a July evening
can find in central Ohio.</p>

<p class='c003'>“My friend, Mr. Marley, Mrs. Carter—Glenn
Marley—you’ve heard of him, Captain.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley bowed and said something. The presentation
there in the darkness made it rather difficult
for him, and neither the captain nor his wife
moved. Lawrence sat down on the steps and
fanned himself with his hat.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Been a hot day, Captain,” he said. “Think
there’s any sign of rain?” He sniffed the air.
The captain did not need to sniff the air to be able
to reply, in a voice that rumbled up from his
bending figure, that he had no hope of any.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Mayme’s home, ain’t she?” asked Lawrence,
turning to Mrs. Carter.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll go see,” said Mrs. Carter, and she rose
quickly, as if glad to get away, and the screen
door slammed again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Billy was in the bank to-day,” Lawrence went
on, speaking to Captain Carter. “He said your
wheat was ready to cut. Did you get Foose all
right?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” said the captain, “he’ll give me next
week.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you have to board the threshers?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, not this year; they bring along their own
cook, and a tent and everything.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Je-rusalem!” exclaimed Lawrence. “Things
<em>are</em> changing in these days, ain’t they? Harvesting
ain’t as hard on the women-folks as it used
to be.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” said the captain, “but I pay for it, so
much extra a bushel.”</p>

<p class='c003'>His head shook regretfully, but he would have
lost his regrets in telling of the time when he had
swung a cradle all day in the harvest field, had
not Mrs. Carter’s voice just then been heard calling
up the stairs:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Mayme!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Whoo!” answered a high, feminine voice.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come down. There’s some one here to see
you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Carter turned into the parlor, and the tall
windows that opened to the floor of the veranda
burst into light.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She’ll be right down, John,” said Mrs. Carter,
appearing in the door. “You give me your
hats and go right in.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“All right,” said Lawrence, and he got to his
feet. “Come on, Glenn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Carter took the hats of the young men
and hung them on the rack, where they might
easily have hung them themselves. Then she
went back to the veranda, letting the screen door
bang behind her, and Lawrence and Marley entered
the parlor. Marley took his seat on one of
the haircloth chairs that seemed to have ranged
themselves permanently along the walls, and
Lawrence went to the square piano that stood across
one corner of the room, and sat down tentatively
on the stool, swinging from side to side.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley glanced at the pictures on the walls.
One of them was a steel engraving of Lincoln and
his cabinet; another, in a black oval frame, portrayed
Captain Carter in uniform, his hair dusting
the strapped shoulders of a coat made after
the pattern that seems to have been worn so uncomfortably
by the heroes of the Civil War. There
was, however, a later picture of the captain, a crayon
enlargement of a photograph, that had taken
him in civilian garb. This picture, in its huge
gilt frame, was the most aggressive thing in the
room, except, possibly, the walnut what-not. Marley
had a great fear of the what-not; it seemed
to him that if he stirred he must topple it over,
and dash its load of trinkets to the floor.
Presently he heard the swish of skirts. Then a
tall girl came in, and Lawrence sprang to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hello, Mayme. What’d you run for?” he
said.</p>

<p class='c003'>He had crossed the room and seized the girl’s
hand. She flashed a rebuke at him, though it
was evident that the rebuke was more out of deference
to the strange presence of Marley than for
any real resentment she felt.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This is my friend, Mr. Marley, Miss Carter,”
Lawrence said. “You’ve heard me speak of him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley edged away from the what-not, rose and
took the hand the girl gave him. Then Miss Carter
crossed to the black haircloth sofa and seated
herself, smoothing out her skirts.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Didn’t know what to do, so we thought we’d
come out and see you,” said Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, indeed!” said Miss Carter. “Well, it’s
too bad about you. We’ll do when you can’t find
anybody else to put up with you, eh?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, yes, you’ll do in a pinch,” chaffed Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, can’t you find a comfortable seat?” the
girl asked, still addressing Lawrence, who had
gone back to the piano stool.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m going to play in a minute,” said Lawrence,
“and sing.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, excuse <em>me</em>!” implored Miss Carter. “Do
let me get you a seat.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence promptly went over to the sofa and
leaned back in one corner of it, affecting a discomfort.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Can’t I get you a pillow, Mr. Lawrence?”
Miss Carter asked presently. “Or perhaps a cot;
I believe there’s one somewhere in the attic.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I reckon I can stand it,” said Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley had regained his seat on the edge of the
slippery chair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Where’s Vinie?” asked Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She’s coming,” answered Miss Carter.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Taking out her curl papers, eh?” said Lawrence.
“She needn’t mind us.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Miss Carter pretended a disgust, but as she was
framing a retort, somehow, the eyes of all of them
turned toward the hall door. A girl in a gown of
white stood there clasping and unclasping her
hands curiously, and looking from one to another
of those in the room.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come in, Lavinia,” said Miss Carter. Something
had softened her voice. The girl stepped
into the room almost timidly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Miss Blair,” said Miss Carter, “let me introduce
Mr. Marley.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The sudden consciousness that he had been sitting—and
staring—smote Marley, and he sprang
to his feet. Embarrassment overpowered him and
he bowed awkwardly. Lawrence had been silent,
and his silence had been a long one for him. Seeming
to recognize this he hastened to say:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, how’s the world using you, Vinie?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The girl smiled and answered:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, pretty well, thank you, Jack.”</p>

<p class='c003'>It grated on Marley to hear her called Vinie.
Lavinia Blair! Lavinia Blair! That was her
name. He had heard it before, of course, yet it
had never sounded as it did now when he repeated
it to himself. The girl had seated herself in a
rocking-chair across the room, almost out of range,
as it were. He was rather glad of this, if anything.
It seemed to relieve him of the duty of
talking to her. He supposed, of course, they
would pair off somehow. The young people always
did in Macochee. He supposed he had been
brought there to pair off with Lavinia Blair. He
liked the thought, yet the position had its responsibilities.
Somehow he never could forget that he
could not dance. He hoped they would not
propose dancing. He always had a fear of that in
making calls, and all the calls he made seemed
to come to it soon or late; some one always proposed
it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was aware that Lawrence and Mayme
Carter had resumed the exchange of their rude
repartee, though he did not know what they had
said. They kept laughing, too. Lavinia Blair
seemed to join in the laughter if not in the badinage.
Marley wished he might join in it. Jack
Lawrence was evidently funnier than ever that
night; Mayme Carter was convulsed. Now and
then Lawrence said something to her in a tone too
low for the others to hear, and these remarks
pushed her to the verge of hysterics. Marley had
a notion they were laughing at him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Meanwhile Lavinia Blair sat with her hands
in her lap, smiling as though she were amused.
Marley wondered if he amused her. He felt that
he ought to say something, but he did not know
what to say. He thought of several things, but, as
he turned them over in his mind, he was convinced
that they were not appropriate. So he sat
and looked at Lavinia Blair, looked at her eyes, her
mouth, her hair. He thought he had never seen
such a complexion.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mayme Carter had snatched her handkerchief
back from Lawrence, and retreated to her end
of the sofa. There she sat up stiffly, folded her
hands, and, though her mirth still shook her spasmodically,
she said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now, Jack, behave yourself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence burlesqued a surprise, and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll leave it to Vine if I’ve done anything.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley wondered how much further abbreviation
Lavinia Blair’s name would stand, but he was suddenly
aware that he was being addressed. Miss
Carter, with an air of dismissing Lawrence,
said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You have not been in Macochee long, have
you, Mr. Marley?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley admitted that he had not, but said that
he liked the town. When Lawrence explained
that Marley was going to settle down there and
become one of them, Miss Carter said she was
awfully glad, but warned him against associating
too much with Lawrence. This embarrassed Marley,
if it did not Lawrence, and he immediately
gave the scene to Lawrence, who guessed he would
sing his song. To do so he went to the piano, and
began to pick over the frayed sheets of music that
lay on its green cover. To forestall him, however,
Miss Carter rushed across the room and slid on to
the piano stool herself, saying breathlessly:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Anything to stop that!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She struck a few vagrant chords, and Marley,
glad of a subject on which he could express himself,
pleaded with her to play. At last she did so.
When she had finished, Lawrence clapped his
hands loudly, and stopped only when a voice
startled them. It was Mrs. Carter calling through
the window:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Play your new piece, Mayme!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Miss Carter demurred, but after they had argued
the question through the window, the daughter
gave in, and played it. The music soothed
Lawrence to silence, and when Miss Carter completed
her little repertoire, his mockery could recover
itself no further than to say:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Won’t you favor us, Miss Blair?”</p>

<p class='c003'>When Lavinia Blair declined, he struck an imploring
attitude and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, please do! We’re dying to hear you. You
didn’t leave your music at home, did you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley heard the chairs scraping on the
veranda, and the screen door slammed once more.
Then he heard Captain Carter go up the stairs,
while Mrs. Carter halted in the doorway of the
parlor long enough to say:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You lock the front door when you come up,
Mayme.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mayme without turning replied “All right,”
and when her mother had disappeared she said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s awful hot in here, let’s go outside.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley found himself strolling in the yard with
Lavinia Blair. The moon had not risen, but the
girl’s throat and arms gleamed in the starlight;
her white dress seemed to be a cloud of gauze; she
floated, rather than walked, there by his side.
They paused by the gate. About them were the
voices of the summer night, the crickets, the katydids,
far away the frogs, chirping musically. They
stood a while in the silence, and then they turned,
and were talking again.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley did most of the talking, and all he
said was about himself, though he did not realize
that this was so. He had already told her of
his life in the towns where his father had preached
before he came to Macochee, and of his four years
in college at Delaware. He tried to give her some
notion of the sense of alienation he had felt as the
son of an itinerant Methodist minister; for him
no place had ever taken on the warm color and expression
of home. He explained that as yet
he knew little of Macochee, having been away at
college when his father moved there the preceding
fall. It was so easy to talk to her, and as he told
her of his ambitions, the things he was going to do
became so many, and so easy. He was going
to become a lawyer; he thought he should go to
Cincinnati.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And leave Macochee?” said Lavinia Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley caught his breath.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Would you care?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c003'>She did not answer. He heard the crickets, the
katydids, the frogs again; there came the perfume
of the lilacs, late flowering that year; the
heavy odor of a shrub almost overpowered him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“My father is a lawyer,” Lavinia said.</p>

<p class='c003'>They had turned off the path, and were
wandering over the lawn. The dew sparkled on it; and
Marley became solicitous.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Won’t you get your feet wet?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>The girl laughed at the idea, but she caught up
her skirts, and they wandered on in the shade of
the tall elms. Marley did not know where they
were. The yard seemed an endless garden, immense,
unknown, enchanted; the dark trees all
around him stood like the forest of some park, and
the lawn stretched away to fall over endless terraces;
he imagined statues and fountains gleaming
in the heavy shadows of the trees. The house
seemed lost in the distance, though he felt its presence
there behind him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Once he saw the twinkle of a passing light in
an upper story. He could no longer hear the
voices of Mayme and Lawrence, but he caught
the tinkling notes of a banjo, away off somewhere.
Its music was very sweet. They strolled on, their
feet swishing in the damp grass, then suddenly
there was a rush, a loud barking, and a dog sprang
at them out of the darkness. Lavinia gave a little
cry. Marley was startled; he felt that he must
run, yet he thought of the girl beside him. He
must not let her see his fear. He stepped in front
of her. He could feel her draw more closely to
him, and he thrilled as the sense of his protectorship
came to him. He must think of some heroic
scheme of vanquishing the dog, but it stopped in
its mad rush, and Lavinia, standing aside, said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, it’s only Sport!”</p>

<p class='c003'>They laughed, and their laugh was the happier
because of the relief from their fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We must have wandered around behind the
house,” said Lavinia. “There’s the shed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They turned, and went back. The enchantment
of the yard had departed. Marley seemed to
see things clearly once more, though his heart still
beat as he felt the delicious sense of protectorship
that had come over him as Lavinia shrank to his
side at the moment the dog rushed at them. Nor
could he ever forget her face as she smiled up at
him in the little opening they came into on the side
lawn. The young moon was just sailing over the
trees. As they approached the veranda, Lawrence’s
voice called out of the darkness:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, where have you young folks been stealing
away to?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />WADE POWELL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley halted at the threshold and glanced
up at the sign that swung over the doorway.
The gilt lettering of the sign had long ago
been tarnished, and where its black sanded
paint had peeled in many weathers the original
tin was as rusty as the iron arm from
which it creaked. Yet Macochee had long since
lost its need of the shingle to tell it where Wade
Powell’s law office was. It had been for many
years in one of the little rooms of the low brick
building in Miami Street, just across from the
Court House; it was almost as much of an institution
as the Court House itself, with which its
triumphs and its trials were identified. Marley
gathered enough courage from his inspection of
the sign to enter, but once inside, he hesitated.
Then a heavy voice spoke.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, come in,” it said peremptorily.</p>

<p class='c003'>Wade Powell, sitting with his feet on his table,
held his newspaper aside and looked at Marley
over his spectacles. Marley had had an ideal of
Wade Powell, and now he had to pause long enough
to relinquish the ideal and adjust himself to the
reality. The hair was as disordered as his young
fancy would have had it, but it was thinner than
he had known it in his dreams, and its black
was streaked with gray. The face was smooth-shaven,
which accorded with his notion, though
it had not been shaven as recently as he felt it
should have been. But he could not reconcile himself
to the spectacles that rested on Powell’s nose,
and pressed their bows into the flesh of his temples—the
eagle eyes of the Wade Powell of his imagination
had never known glasses.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Wade Powell slowly pulled his spectacles
from his nose and tossed them on to the
table before him, he bent his eyes on Marley,
and their gaze, under their heavy brows, somewhat
restored him, but it could not atone for the
disappointment. Perhaps the disappointment that
Marley felt in this moment came from some dim,
unrealized sense that Wade Powell was growing
old. The spectacles, the gray in his hair, the
wrinkles in his face, the looseness of the skin at
his jaws and at his throat—where a fold of it hung
between the points of his collar—all told that Wade
Powell had passed the invisible line which marks
life’s summit, and that his face was turned now
toward the evening. There was the touch of sadness
in the indistinct conception of him as a man
who had not altogether realized the ambitions of
his youth or the predictions of his friends, and
the sadness came from the intuition that the failure
or the half-failure was not of the heroic kind.</p>

<p class='c003'>The office in which he sat, and on which, in
the long years, he had impressed his character, was
untidy; the floor was dirty, the books on the shelves
were dusty and leaning all awry; the set of the
Ohio reports had not been kept up to date; one
might have told by a study of them at just what
period enterprise and energy had faltered, while
the gaps here and there showed how an uncalculating
generosity had helped a natural indolence by
lending indiscriminately to other lawyers, who,
with the lack of respect for the moral of the laws
they pretended to revere, had borrowed with no
thought of returning.</p>

<p class='c003'>Two or three pictures hung crookedly on the
walls; the table at which Powell sat was old and
scarred; its ink-stand had long ago gone dry and
been abandoned; a cheap bottle, with its cork rolling
tipsily by its side, had taken the ink-stand’s
place. The papers scattered over the table had an
air of hopelessness, as though they had grown
tired, like the clients they represented, in waiting
for Powell’s attention. The half-open door at the
back led into a room that had been, and possibly
might yet be, used as a private office or consulting
room, should any one care to brave its darkness
and its dust; but as for Wade Powell, it was
plain that he preferred to sit democratically in
the outer office, where all might see him, and, what
was of more importance to him, where he might
see all.</p>

<p class='c003'>The one new thing in the room was a typewriter,
standing on its little sewing-machine table, in the
corner of the room. There was no stenographer
nor any chair for one; Marley imagined Powell,
whenever he had occasion to write, sitting down
to the machine himself, and picking out his pleadings
painfully, laboriously and slowly, letter by
letter, using only his index fingers. And this
somehow humbled his ideal the more. Marley
almost wished he hadn’t come.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’s on your mind, young man?” said Wade
Powell, leaning back in his chair and dropping
his long arm at his side until his newspaper swept
the floor. Marley had seated himself in a wooden
chair that was evidently intended for clients, and
he began nervously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I—”</p>

<p class='c003'>Here he stopped, overcome again by an embarrassment.
A smile spread over Wade Powell’s face,
a gentle smile with a winning quality in it, and
his face to Marley became young again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tell your troubles,” he said. “I’ve confessed
all the young men in Macochee for twenty-five
years. Yes—thirty-five—” He grew suddenly
sober as he numbered the years and then exclaimed
as if to himself:</p>

<p class='c003'>“My God! Has it been that long?”</p>

<p class='c003'>He took out his watch and looked at it as if it
must somehow correct his reckoning. For a
moment, then, he thought; his gaze was far away.
But Marley brought him back when he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I only want—I only want to study law.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!” said Powell, and he seemed somehow relieved.
“Is that all?”</p>

<p class='c003'>To Marley this seemed quite enough, and the
disappointment he felt, which was a part of the
effect Wade Powell’s office had had on him, showed
suddenly in his face. Powell glanced quickly at
him, and hastened to reassure him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We can fix that easily enough,” he said. “Have
you ever read any law?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” said Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Been to college?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley told him that he had just that summer
been graduated and when he mentioned the name of
the college Powell said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“The Methodists, eh?”</p>

<p class='c003'>He could hardly conceal a certain contempt in
the tone with which he said this, and then, as if
instantly regretting the unkindness, he observed:</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s a good school, I’m told.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He could not, however, evince an entire
approval, and so seeming to desert the subject he
hastened on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Glenn Marley.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!” Wade Powell dropped his feet to the
floor and sat upright. “Are you Preacher Marley’s
son?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley did not like to hear his father called
“Preacher,” and when he said that he was the
son of Doctor Marley, Powell remarked:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve heard him preach, and he’s a damn good
preacher too, I want to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley warmed under this profane indorsement.
He had always, from a boy, felt somehow that he
must defend his father’s position as a preacher
from the world, as with the little world of his boyhood
and youth he had always had to defend his
own position as the son of a preacher.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, sir, he’s a good preacher, and a good
man,” Powell went on. He had taken a cigar from
his pocket and was nipping the end from it with
his teeth. He lighted it, and leaned back comfortably
again to smoke, and then in tardy hospitality
he drew another cigar from his waistcoat pocket
and held it toward Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Smoke?” he said, and then he added apologetically,
“I didn’t think; I never do.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley declined the cigar, but Powell pressed
it on him, saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, your father does, I’ll bet. Give it to him
with Wade Powell’s compliments. He won’t hesitate
to smoke with a publican and sinner.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley smiled and put the cigar away in his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t know, though,” Powell went on slowly,
speaking as much to himself as to Marley, while
he watched the thick white clouds he rolled from
his lips, “that he’d want you to be in my office.
I know some of the <em>brethren</em> wouldn’t approve.
They’d think I’d contaminate you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley would have hastened to reassure Powell
had he known how to do so without seeming to
recognize the possibility of contamination; but
while he hesitated Powell avoided the necessity
for him by asking:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did your father send you to me?”</p>

<p class='c003'>He looked at Marley eagerly, and with an
expression of unfounded hope, as he awaited the
answer.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” replied Marley, “he doesn’t know. I
haven’t talked with him at all. I have to do something
and I’ve always thought I’d go into the
law. I presume it would be better to go to a law
school, but father couldn’t afford that after putting
me through college. I thought I could read law
in some office, and maybe get admitted that way.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Sure,” said Powell, “it’s easy enough. You’ll
have to learn the law after you get to practising
anyway—and there isn’t much to learn at that. It’s
mostly a fake.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked at him in some alarm, at this new
smiting of an idol.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I began to read law,” Powell went on, “under
old Judge Colwin—that is, what I read. I used
to sit at the window with a book in my lap and
watch the girls go by. Still,” he added with a
tone of doing himself some final justice, “it was a
liberal education to sit under the old judge’s drippings.
I learned more that way than I ever did at
the law school.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He smoked on a moment, ruminating on his lost
youth; then, bringing himself around to business
again, he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“How’d you happen to come to me?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” said Marley, haltingly, “I’d heard a
good deal of you—and I thought I’d like you, and
then I’ve heard father speak of you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You have?” said Powell, looking up quickly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’d he say?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, he said you were a great orator and he
said you were always with the under dog. He
said he liked that.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell turned his eyes away and his face reddened.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, let’s see. If you think your father
would approve of your sitting at the feet of such
a Gamaliel as I, we can—” He was squinting
painfully at his book-shelves. “Is that Blackstone
over there on the top shelf?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley got up and glanced along the backs of the
dingy books, their calfskin bindings deeply
browned by the years, their red and black labels
peeling off.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here’s Blackstone,” he said, taking down a
book, “but it’s the second volume.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Second volume, eh? Don’t see the first around
anywhere, do you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked, without finding it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then see if Walker’s there.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Walker’s <em>American Law</em>,” Powell explained.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t see it,” Marley said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I reckon not,” assented Powell, “some one’s
borrowed it. I seem to run a sort of circulating
library of legal works in this town, without fines—though
we have statutes against petit larceny. Well,
hand me Swan’s <em>Treatise</em>. That’s it, on the end
of the second shelf.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley took down the book, and gave it to
Powell. While Marley dusted his begrimed fingers
with his handkerchief, Powell blew the dust off
the top of the book; he slapped it on the arm of
his chair, the dust flying from it at every stroke.
He picked up his spectacles, put them on and
turned over the first few leaves of the book.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You might begin on that,” he said presently,
“until we can borrow a Blackstone or a Walker
for you. This book is the best law-book ever written
anyway; the law’s all there. If you knew all
that contains, you could go in any court and get
along without giving yourself away; which is the
whole duty of a lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He closed the book and gave it to Marley, who
was somewhat at a loss; this was the final disappointment.
He had thought that his introduction
into the mysteries of the noble profession should
be attended by some sort of ceremony. He looked
at the book in his hand quite helplessly and then
looked up at Powell.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is that—all?” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, yes,” Powell answered. “Isn’t that
enough?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I thought—that is, that I might have some duties.
How am I to begin?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, just open the book to the first page and
read that, then turn over to the second page and
read that, and so on—till you get to the end.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What will my hours be?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Your hours?” said Powell, as if he did not understand.
“Oh, just suit yourself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was looking at the book again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t you make any entry—any memorandum?”
he asked, still unable to separate himself
from the idea that something formal, something
legal, should mark the beginning of such an important
epoch.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, you keep track of the date,” said Powell,
“and at the end of three years I’ll give you a certificate.
You may find that you can do most of
your reading at home, but come around.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked about the office, trying to imagine
himself in this new situation.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’d like, you know,” he said, “to do something,
if I could, to repay you for your trouble.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s all right, my boy,” said Powell. Then
he added as if the thought had just come to him:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Say, can you run a typewriter?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I can learn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, that’s more than I can do,” said Powell,
glancing at his new machine. “I’ve tried, but it
would take a stationary engineer to operate that
thing. You might help out with my letters and
my pleadings now and then. And I’d like to have
you around. You’d make good company.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” said Marley, “I’ll be here in the
morning.” He still clung to the idea that he was to be a
part of the office, to be an identity in the local machinery
of the law. As he rose to go, a young
man appeared in the doorway. He was tall, and
the English cap and the rough Scotch suit he wore,
with the trousers rolled up over his heavy tan
shoes, enabled Marley to identify him instantly as
young Halliday. He was certain of this when
Powell, looking up, said indifferently:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hello, George. Raining in London?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I say, Powell,” replied Halliday, ignoring
a taunt that had grown familiar to him, “that
Zeller case—we would like to have that go over
to the fall term, if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why don’t you settle it?” asked Powell.</p>

<p class='c003'>Halliday was leaning against the door-post, and
had drawn a short brier pipe from his pocket. Before
he answered, he paused long enough to fill it
with tobacco. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’ll have to see the governor about that—it’s
a case he’s been looking after.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, well,” said Powell, with his easy acquiescence,
“all right.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Halliday had pressed the tobacco into the bowl
of the pipe and struck a match.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then, I’ll tell old Bill,” he said, pausing in
his sentence to light his pipe, “to mark it off
the assignment.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley watched Halliday saunter away, with
a feeling that mixed admiration with amazement.
He could not help admiring his clothes, and he
felt drawn toward him as a college man from a
school so much greater than his own, though he
felt some resentment because Halliday had never
once given a sign that he was aware of Marley’s
presence. His amazement came from the utter
disrespect with which Halliday referred to Judge
Blair. Old Bill! Marley had caught his breath.
He would have liked to discuss Halliday with
Powell, but the lawyer seemed to be as indifferent
to Halliday’s existence as Halliday had been
to Marley’s, and when Marley saw that Powell
was not likely to refer to him, he started toward
the door. As he went Powell resumptively called
after him:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll get a Blackstone for you in a day or two.
Be down in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley went away bearing Swan’s <em>Treatise</em> under
his arm. He looked up at the Court House
across the way; the trees were stirring in the
light winds of summer, and their leaves writhed
joyously in the sun. The windows of the Court
House were open, and he could hear the voice of
some lawyer arguing a cause to the jury. Marley
thought of Judge Blair sitting there, the jury in
its box, the sleepy bailiff drowsing in his place,
the accustomed attorneys and the angry litigants,
and his heart began to beat a little more rapidly,
for the thought of Judge Blair brought the thought
of Lavinia Blair. And in the days to come, when
he should be arguing a cause to a jury, as that
lawyer, whose voice came pealing and echoing in
sudden and surprising shouts through the open
windows, was arguing a cause now, would Lavinia
Blair be interested?</p>

<p class='c003'>He had imagined that a day so full of importance
for him would be marked by greater ceremonials,
and yet while he was disappointed, he was
reassured. He had solved a problem, he had done
with inaction, he had made a beginning, he was
entered at last upon a career. As all the events
of the recent years rushed on him, the years of college
life, the decisions and indecisions of his classmates,
their vague troubles about a career, he felt
a pride that he had so soon solved that problem.
He felt a certain superiority too, that made him
carry his head high, as he turned into Main
Street and marched across the Square. It required
only decision and life was conquered. He saw
the years stretching out prosperously before him,
expanding as his ambitions expanded. He was
glad that he had tackled life so promptly, that he
had come so quickly to an issue with it; it was not
so bad, viewed thus close, as it had been from
a distance. He laughed at the folly of all the talk
he had heard about the difficulty of young men
getting a start in these days; he must write to
his fraternity fellows at once, and tell them what
he had done and how he was succeeding. They
would surely see that at the bar he would do, not
only himself, but them, the greatest credit, and
they would be proud.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />GREENWOOD LAKE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The girls, flitting about with nervous laughter
and now and then little screams, had spread
long cloths over the table of plain boards
that had served so many picnic parties at
Greenwood Lake; the table-cloths and the dresses
of the girls gleamed white in the amber light that
streamed across the little sheet of water, though
the slender trees, freshened by the morning shower
that threatened to spoil the outing, were beginning
to darken under the shadows that diffused themselves
subtly through the grove, as if there were
exudations of the heavy foliage.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence, in his white ducks, stood by the table,
assuming to direct the laying of the supper. His
immense cravat of blue was the only bit of color
about him, unless it were his red hair, which he
had had clipped that very morning, and his shorn
appearance intensified his comic air. Marley, sitting
apart on the stump of a small oak, could hear
the burlesque orders Lawrence shouted at the girls.
The girls were convulsed by his orders; at times
they had to put their dishes down lest in their
laughter they spill the food or break the china;
just then Marley saw Mayme Carter double over
suddenly, her mass of yellow hair lurching forward
to her brow, while the woods rang with her laughter.
The other men were off looking after the
horses.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia moved quickly here and there, smiling
joyously, her face flushed; though she laughed
as the others did at Lawrence’s drollery, she did not
laugh as loudly, and she did not scream. Just
now she rose from bending over the table, and
brushed her brown hair from her brow with the
back of her hand, while she stood and surveyed
the table as if to see what it lacked. When she
raised her hand the sleeve of her muslin gown
fell away from her wrist and showed her
slender forearm, white in the calm light of evening.
Marley could not take his eyes from her.
She ran into the pavilion, her little low shoes
flashed below her petticoats, and he grew sad; when
she reappeared, all her movements seemed to be
new, to have fresh beauties. Then he suspected
that the girls were laughing at him and he felt
miserable.</p>

<p class='c003'>He thought of himself sitting alone and apart,
an awkward, ungainly figure. He longed to go
away, yet he feared that, if he did, he would not
have the courage to come back. He shifted his position,
only to make matters worse. Then suddenly
his feeling took the form of a rage with
Lawrence; he longed to seize Lawrence and kick
him, to pitch him into the lake, to humiliate him
before the girls. He thought he saw all at once
that Lawrence had been making fun of him, surreptitiously;
that was what had made the girls
laugh so.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was some little consolation in the thought
that Lavinia did not laugh as much as the others;
perhaps, if she did not care to defend him, she
at least pitied him. And then he began to pity
himself. The whole evening stretched before him;
pretty soon he would have to move up to the table,
and sit down on the narrow little benches that
were fastened between the trees; then after supper
they would begin their dancing and when that
came he did not see what he could do.</p>

<p class='c003'>The only pleasure he had had that afternoon had
been on the way out; he had been alone with Lavinia,
and the four miles of pleasant road that
lay between the town and Greenwood Lake were
too short for all the happiness Marley found in
them. He could feel Lavinia again by his side, her
hands folded on the thin old linen lap-robe. He
could not recall a word they had said, but it seemed
to him that the conversation had flowed on intimately
and tranquilly; she had been so close and
sympathetic; and he would always remember how
her eyes had been raised to his. The fields with the
wheat in shock had swept by in the beauty of harvest
time; the road, its dust laid by the morning
shower, had rolled under the wheels of the buggy
softly, smoothly and noiselessly; the air had been
odorous with the scent of green things freshened
by the rain, and had vibrated with the sounds of
summer.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then suddenly his reverie was broken. The
men were gathering about the table with the girls;
all of them looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here, you!” called Lawrence. “Do you think
we’re going to do all the work? Come, get in
the game, and don’t look so solemn—this ain’t a
funeral.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They all laughed, and Marley felt his face flame,
but he rose and went over to the table, halting in
indecision.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Run get some water,” ordered Lawrence, imperatively
waving his hand. “Mayme,” he
shouted, “hand him the pitcher! Step lively, now.
The men-folks are hungry after their day’s work.
Has any one got a pitcher concealed about his
person? What did you do with the pitcher, Glenn?
Take it to water your horse?”</p>

<p class='c003'>They were laughing uproariously, and Marley
was plainly discomfited. But Lavinia stepped to
his side, a large white pitcher in her hand. “I’ll
show you,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>They started away together, and Marley felt a
protection in her presence. A little way farther
he suddenly thought of the pitcher, which Lavinia
still was bearing, and he took it from her. As he
seized the handle their fingers became for an instant
entangled.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did I hurt you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, no!” she assured him, and as they walked
on, out of the sight of the laughing group behind
them, an ease came over him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you know where the well is?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, yes,” she answered. “It’s down here. I
could have come just as well as not.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m glad to come,” he said; and then he
added, “with <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They had reached the wooden pump behind the
pavilion. The little sheet of water curved away
like a crescent, following the course of the stream
of which it was but a widening. Its little islands
were mirrored in its surface. The sun was just
going down, the sky beyond the lake was rosy, and
the same rosy hue now suffused everything; the
waters themselves were reddened.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was very still, and the peace of the evening lay
on them both. Lavinia stood motionless, and
looked out across the water to the little Ohio hills
that rolled away toward the west. She stood and
gazed a long time, her hands at her sides, yet
with their fingers open and extended, as if the
beauty of the scene had suddenly transfixed her.
Marley did not see the lake or the sun, the islands
or the hills; he saw only the girl before him, the
outline of her cheek, the down on it showing fine
in the pure light, the hair that nestled at her
neck, the curve from her shoulder to her arms and
down to her intent fingers. At last she sighed, and
looked up at him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Isn’t it all beautiful?” she said solemnly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Beautiful?” he repeated, as if in question, not
knowing what she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just then they heard Lawrence hallooing, and
Marley began to pump vigorously. He rinsed out
the pitcher, then filled it, and they went back, walking
closely side by side, and they did not speak all
the way.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mayme Carter, who, as it seemed, had a local
reputation as a compounder of lemonade, had the
lemons and the sugar all ready when Marley and
Lavinia rejoined the group, and Lawrence, as he
seized the pitcher, said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I see that, between you, you’ve spilled nearly
all of the water, but I guess Mayme and I’ll have
to make it do.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The others laughed at this, as they did at all of
Lawrence’s speeches, and then they turned and
laughed at Marley and Lavinia, though the men,
who as yet did not feel themselves on terms with
Marley, had a subtile manner of not including
him in their ridicule, however little they spared
Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>The supper was eaten with the hunger their spirits
and the fresh air had given them and Marley,
placed, as of course, by Lavinia’s side, felt sheltered
by her, as he felt sheltered by all the talk that
raged about him. He wished that he could join in
the talk, but he could not discover what it was all
about. Once, in a desperate determination to
assert himself, he did mention a book he had been
reading, but his remark seemed to have a chilling
effect from which they did not recover until Lawrence,
out of his own inexhaustible fund of nonsense,
restored them to their inanities. He tried to
hide his embarrassment by eating the cold chicken,
the ham and sardines, the potato chips and pickles,
the hard-boiled eggs and sandwiches that went up
and down the board in endless procession, and he
was thankful, when he thought of it, that Lawrence
seemed to forget him, though Lawrence
had forgotten no one else there. He seemed
to note accurately each mouthful every one took.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hand up another dozen eggs for Miss Winters,
Joe,” he called to one of the men, and then
they all laughed at Miss Winters.</p>

<p class='c003'>When the cake came, Lawrence identified each
kind with some remark about the mother of the
girl who had brought it, and tasted all, because, as
he said, he could not afford to show partiality.
The fun lagged somewhat as the meal neared its
end, but Lawrence revived it instantly and sensationally
by rising suddenly, bending far over
toward Lavinia in a tragic attitude and saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, Vine, child, you haven’t eaten a mouthful!
I do believe you’re in love!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The company burst into laughter, but they suddenly
stopped when they saw Marley. His face
showed his anger with them, and he made a little
movement, but Lavinia smiled up at Lawrence, and
said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, Jack, it’s evident that <em>you’re</em> not.”</p>

<p class='c003'>And then they all laughed at Lawrence, and
the girls clapped their hands, while Marley, angry
now with himself, tried to laugh with them.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they stopped laughing Lawrence produced
his cigarettes, and tossing one to Marley in a way
that delicately conveyed a sense of intimacy and
affection, he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“When you girls get your dishes done up we’ll
be back and see if we can’t think up something to
entertain you,” and then he called Marley and
with him and the other men strolled down to the
lake.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />MOONLIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The dance was proposed almost immediately.
Marley had hoped up to the very last minute
that something, possibly a miracle, would prevent
it, but scarcely had the men finished their
first cigarettes before Howard was saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, let’s be getting back to the girls. They’ll
want to dance.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Howard spoke as if the dancing would be a sacrifice
on the part of the men to the pleasure of the
girls, but they all turned at once, some of them
flinging their cigarettes into the water, as if to complete
the sacrifice, and started back. When they
reached the pavilion, Payson and Gallard took instruments
out of green bags, Payson a guitar and
Gallard a mandolin, and Lawrence, bustling about
over the floor, shoving the few chairs against the
unplastered wooden walls, was shouting:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tune ’em up, boys, tune ’em up!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The first tentative notes of the strings twanged
in the hollow room, and Lawrence was asking the
girls for dances, scribbling their names on his cuff
with a disregard of its white polished linen almost
painful.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll have to divide up some of ’em, you know,
girls,” he said. “Jim and Elmer have to play, and
that makes us two men shy. But I’ll do the best
I can—wish I could take you all in my arms at once
and dance with you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The girls, standing in an expectant, eager little
group, clutched one another nervously, and pretended
to sneer at Lawrence’s patronage.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was standing with Lavinia near the door.
He was trying to affect an ease; he knew by the
way the other girls glanced at him now and then
that they were speculating on his possibilities as a
partner; he tried just then to look as if he were
going to dance as all the other men were, yet he
felt the necessity of confessing to Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You know,” he said contritely, “that I don’t
dance.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She looked up, a disappointment springing to her
eyes too quickly for her to conceal it. She was
flushed with pleasure and excitement, and tapping
her foot in time with the chords Payson and Gallard
were trying on their instruments. Marley
saw her surprise.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I ought not to have come,” he said; “I’ve no
business here.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The look of disappointment in Lavinia’s eyes
had gone, and in its place was now an expression
of sympathy.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It makes no difference,” she said. And then
she added in a low voice: “I’ll not dance either;
there are too many of us girls anyway.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, don’t let me keep you from it,” said Marley,
and yet a joy was shining in his eyes. She
turned away and blushed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll give you all my dances,” she said; “we
can sit them out.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But it won’t be any fun for you,” protested
Marley. And just then Lawrence came up.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Say, Glenn,” he said, “if you don’t want to
dance I’ll take Lavinia for the first number.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The guitar and mandolin, after a long preliminary
strumming to get themselves in tune,
suddenly burst into <em>The Georgia Campmeeting</em>, and
the couples were instantly springing across the
floor.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come on, Vine,” said Lawrence, his fingers
twitching. And Lavinia, eager, trembling, alive,
casting one last glance at Marley, said “Just this
one!” and went whirling away with Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley moved aside, awkwardly, when the couples,
sweeping in a long oval stream around the
little room, whirled past him. Lavinia danced
with a grace that almost hurt him; she was laughing
as she looked up into Lawrence’s face, talking
to him as they danced. Marley felt a gloom, almost
a rage, settle on him. He looked up and down the
room. At the farther end, through the door by
which the musicians sat swinging their feet over
their knees in time to the tune they played, he
could see the man who kept the grounds at the lake,
looking on at the dance; his wife was with him,
and they smiled contentedly at the joy of the young
people.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley could not bear their joy, any more than
he could bear the joy of the dancers, and he looked
away from them. Glancing along the wall he saw
a girl, sitting alone. It was Grace Winters; she
was older than the others, and she sat there sullenly,
her dark brows contracted under her dark
hair. Marley felt drawn toward her by a common
trouble, and he thought, instantly, that he might
appear less conspicuous if he went and sat beside
her. As he approached, her sallow face brightened
with a brilliant smile of welcome and she drew
aside her skirts to make a place for him, though
there was no one else on all that side of the room.
Marley sat down.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s warm, isn’t it?” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” Miss Winters replied, “almost too warm
to dance, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley tried to express his acquiescence in the
polite smile he had seen the other men use before
the dance began, but he did not feel that he carried
it off very well.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I should think you’d be dancing, Mr. Marley,”
Miss Winters said. “I hear you are a splendid
dancer. Don’t you care to dance this evening?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I can’t dance,” said Marley, crudely.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was looking at Lavinia, following her young
figure as it glided past with Lawrence. Miss
Winters turned away. Her face became gloomy
again, and she said nothing more. Marley was
absorbed in Lavinia, and they sat there together
silent, conspicuous and alone, in a wide separation.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley thought the dance never would end. It
seemed to him that the dancers must drop from
fatigue; but at last the mandolin and guitar ceased
suddenly, the girls cried out a disappointed unisonant
“Oh!” and then they all laughed and
clapped their hands. Lavinia and Lawrence were
coming up, glowing with the joy of the dance.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, that was splendid, Jack!” Lavinia cried,
putting back her hair with that wave of her hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence’s face was redder than ever. He
leaned over and in a whisper that was for Lavinia
and Marley together he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia, you’re the queen dancer of the town.”
And then he turned to Miss Winters.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Grace,” he said, distributing himself with the
impartiality he felt his position as a social leader
demanded, “you’ve promised me a dance for a long
time. Now’s my chance.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why certainly, Jack,” Miss Winters said, with
her brilliant smile, and then she took Lawrence’s
arm and drew him away, as if otherwise he might
escape.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Take me outdoors!” said Lavinia to Marley.
“Those big lamps make it <em>so</em> hot in here.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was glad to leave, and they went out on
to the little piazza of the pavilion. Lavinia stood
on the very edge of the steps, and drank in the fresh
air eagerly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!” she said. “Oh! Isn’t it delicious!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The darkness lay thick between the trees. The
air was rich with the scent of the mown fields that
lay beyond the grove. The insects shrilled contentedly.
Marley stood and looked at Lavinia, standing
on the edge of the steps, her body bent a little
forward, her face upturned. She put back her hair
again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Let’s go on down!” she said, a little adventurous
quality in her tone. She ran lightly down the
steps, Marley after her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Won’t you take cold?” he asked, bending close
to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She looked up and laughed. They were walking
on, unconsciously making their way toward the
edge of the little lake. Marley felt the white form
floating there beside him and a happiness, new,
unknown before, came to him. They were on the
edge of the little lake. Before them the water
lay, dark now, and smooth. A small stage was
moored to the shore and a boat was fastened to
it. They could hear the light lapping of the water
that barely stirred the boat. Presently Lavinia
ran out on to the stage. She gave a little spring,
and rocked it up and down; then smiled up at
Marley like a child venturing in forbidden places.
Marley stepped carefully on to the stage.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Isn’t it a perfect night?” Lavinia said, looking
up at the dark purple sky, strewn with all the
stars. Marley looked at her white throat.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The most beautiful night I ever knew!” he
said. He spoke solemnly, devoutly, and Lavinia
turned and gazed on him. Marley touched the boat
with the toe of his shoe.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We might row,” he said almost timidly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Could we?” inquired Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“If we may take the boat.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, of course—anybody may. Can you row?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley laughed. He had rowed in the college
crew on the old Olentangy at Delaware. His
laugh was a complete answer to Lavinia. She approached
the boat, and Marley bent over and drew
it alongside the stage.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Get in,” he said. It was good to find something
he could do. He helped her carefully into the
boat, and held it firmly until she had arranged herself
in the stern, her feet against the cleats, and
her white skirts tucked about her. Then he took
his seat, shipped the oars and shoved off. He swept
the boat out into the deep water, and rowed away
up the lake. He rowed precisely, feathering his
oars, that she might see how much a master he was.
They did not speak for a long time. First one, then
the other, of the little islands swept darkly by;
the water slapped the bow of the boat as Marley
urged it forward. The lights of the pavilion on
the shore twinkled an instant, then went out behind
the trees. They could hear the distant mellow
thrumming of the guitar and the tinkle of the
mandolin.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Are you too cool?” he asked presently.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, no, not at all!” said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hadn’t you better take my coat?” Marley
persisted. The idea of putting his coat about her
thrilled him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’ll need it,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I’ll be warm rowing.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She shook her head, and smiled. They drifted
on. Still came the distant strumming of the guitar
and the tinkle of the mandolin. Marley thought of
the young people dancing, and then, noting Lavinia’s
silence, he asked, out of the doubt that was his
one remaining annoyance:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Wouldn’t you rather be back there dancing?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, no!” she answered softly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m ashamed of myself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why?” She started a little.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Because I can’t dance!” There was guilt in
his tone.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You mustn’t feel that way about it,” Lavinia
said. “It’s nothing.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No. It’s easy to learn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I never could learn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia was still, and Marley thought she assented
to this. But in another moment she spoke
again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I—” she began, and then she hesitated.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley stopped rowing and rested on his oars.
The water lapped the bows of the boat as it slackened
its speed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I could teach you,” Lavinia went on.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Could you?” Marley leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’d like to.” She was trailing one white hand
in the water.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Will you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” she said. “We can do it over at Mayme’s—any
time. She’ll play for us.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley felt a great gratitude, and he wondered
how he could pour it forth upon her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You are too good to me,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Then, suddenly, a change came over the dark
surface of the waters. A mellow quality touched
them; they seemed to tremble ecstatically, then they
broke into sparkling ripples; the air quivered with
a luminous beauty and a light flooded the little
valley. Marley and Lavinia turned instinctively
and looked up, and there, over the tops of the
trees, black a moment before, now rounded domes
of silver, rose the moon. They gazed at it a long
time. Finally Marley turned and looked at
Lavinia. Her white dress had become a drapery,
her arms gleamed, her eyes were lustrous in the
transfiguration of the moonlight. He could see
that her lips were slightly parted, and her fingertips,
dipped in the cool water over the gunwale of
the boat, trailed behind them a long narrow thread
of silver. They looked into each other’s eyes, and
neither spoke. They drifted on. At last, Marley
said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She stirred.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you know—” he began, and then he stopped.
“Don’t you know,” he went on, “can’t you see,
that I love you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>He rested his arms on the oars, and leaned over
toward her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve loved you ever since that first night—do
you remember? I know—I know I’m not good
enough, but can’t you—can’t I—love you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>He saw her eyelids fall, and as she turned and
looked over the side of the boat, she put forth
her hand, and he took it.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were awakened from the dream by a call,
and after what seemed to Marley a long time, he
finally remembered the voice as Lawrence’s.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We must go back,” he said reluctantly. “How
long have we been gone?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t know,” said Lavinia. He heard her
sigh.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley pulled the boat in the direction whence
came the hallooing voice; he had quite lost all notion
of their whereabouts. But presently they saw
the lights of the pavilion, and then the dark figures
of the men, and the white figures of the girls
on shore.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they pulled up and Marley sprang out of the
boat to the landing stage, Lawrence said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, where have you babes been?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley helped Lavinia out of the boat.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We’ve been rowing,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We thought you’d been drowned,” said Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley and Lavinia drove home together in silence.
In the light of the moon, the road was silver,
and the fields with their shocks of wheat
were gold.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />THE SERENADE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I don’t know what ails Lavinia,” said Mrs.
Blair to her husband as he sat on the veranda
after dinner the next day. The judge laid his
paper in his lap, and looked up at his wife over
his glasses.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Isn’t she well?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“M—yes,” replied Mrs. Blair, prolonging the
word in her lack of conviction, “I guess so.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t you know?” the judge demanded in some
impatience with her uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She says she feels all right.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, then, what makes you think she isn’t?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Blair, “she
seems so quiet, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia is not a girl given to excitement or
demonstration,” said the judge, lapsing easily into
the manner of speech he had cultivated on the
bench.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, that’s so,” assented Mrs. Blair. “But
she’s always cheerful and bright.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is she gloomy?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I wouldn’t exactly call it that, but she
seems preoccupied—rather wistful I should say,
yes—wistful.” She seemed pleased to have found
the right word.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, she’s all right. That picnic last night may
have fatigued her. I presume there was dancing.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t know that we should let her go out that
way.” The judge took off his glasses and twirled
them by their black cord while he gazed across the
street, apparently at some dogs that were tumbling
each other about in the Chenowiths’ yard. The
judge had a subconscious anxiety that they would
get into Mrs. Chenowith’s flower beds.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You and I used to go to them; they never
hurt us,” argued Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I suppose not. But then—that was different.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair laughed lightly, and the laugh served
to dissipate their cares. She went to the edge of
the veranda and pulled a few leaves from
the climbing rose-vine that grew there, and the
judge put on his glasses and spread out his paper.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll take her out for a drive this afternoon,”
said Mrs. Blair, turning to go indoors.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She’ll be all right,” said the judge, already
deep in the political columns.</p>

<p class='c003'>That night at supper, the judge looked at Lavinia
closely, and after a while he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’re not eating, Lavinia. Don’t you feel
well?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia turned to her father and smiled.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I’m all right.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Her smile perplexed the judge.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You look pale,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair glanced warningly at him the length
of the table.</p>

<p class='c003'>“My girl’s losing her color,” he forged ahead.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia dropped her eyelids, and a look of
pain appeared in her face, causing it to grow paler.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Please don’t worry about me, papa,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair divined Lavinia’s dislike of this
personal discussion. She tried to catch her
husband’s eye again, but he was looking at Lavinia
narrowly through his glasses.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did you go riding this afternoon?” he asked
as if he were examining a witness whom counsel
had not drawn out properly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” Mrs. Blair hastened to say. “We drove
out the Ludlow a long way.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“She was riding last night, too,” said Connie.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Who with?” demanded Chad, turning to Connie
with the challenge he always had ready for
her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Who with?” retorted Connie. “Why, Glenn
Marley, of course. Who else?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, what of it?” demanded Chad. “What’s
it to you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, children, children!” protested Mrs. Blair,
wearily. “Do give us a little peace!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, she began it,” said Chad.</p>

<p class='c003'>Connie was eating savagely, but she whirled on
Chad, speaking with difficulty because her mouth
was filled with food:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You shut up, will you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Chad laughed with a contempt almost theatrical,
waved his hand lightly and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Run away, little girl, run away.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair asked the judge why he did not correct
his children, and though the sigh he gave expressed
the hopelessness, as it seemed to him, of
bringing the two younger members of his train
into anything like decorous behavior, he laid his
knife and fork in his plate.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This must cease,” he said. “It is scandalous.
One might conclude that you were the children of
some family in Lighttown.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It is very trying,” said Mrs. Blair, acquiescing
in her husband’s reproof. “They are just like fire
and tow.” She said this quite impersonally and
then turned to Connie: “If you can’t behave yourself,
I’ll have to send you from the table.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s it!” wailed Connie. “That’s it! Blame
everything on to me!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair looked severely at her, and Connie’s
face reddened. She glanced angrily at her mother
and began again:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I—”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge rapped the table smartly with his
knuckles.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now I want this stopped!” he said. “And
right away. If it isn’t I’ll—” He was about to
say if it wasn’t he would clear the room, as he was
fond of saying whenever the idle spectators in his
court showed signs of being human, but he did
not finish his sentence. Chad was subdued and
decorous, and Connie drooped her head, and began
to gulp her food. Her eyes were filling with tears
and the tears began to fall, slowly, one by one,
splashing heavily into her plate.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia was trembling; she tried to control herself,
tried to lift her glass, but when she did, her
hand shook so that the water was likely to spill.
This completed the undoing of her nerves, her
eyes suddenly flooded with tears, and she snatched
her handkerchief from her lap, rose precipitately,
and hurried from the room, dropping her napkin
as she went. They heard her going up the stairs,
and presently the door of her room closed.</p>

<p class='c003'>Connie had followed Lavinia with her misty
eyes as she left the table and now she too prepared
to leave. She felt a sudden pity springing
from her great love of her older sister, and her
great pride in her, and she felt a contrition, though
she tried to convict Chad, as the latest object of her
fiery and erratic temper, by glowering at him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll go to her,” she said, “<em>I</em> can comfort her!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, stay where you are,” said her mother.
“Just leave her alone.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The evening light of the summer day flooded
into the dining-room; outside a robin was singing.
In the room there was constraint and heavy silence,
broken only by the slight clatter of the silver
or the china. But after a while the judge spoke:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did Lavinia go to the picnic with young Marley?”
he asked. He regretted instantly that he
had revived the topic that had given rise to the difficulty,
but as it lay on the minds of all, it was impossible,
just then, to escape its influence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I believe so,” said Mrs. Blair. “He really
seems like a nice young man.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge scowled.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t know,” he said. “He’s in the office of
Wade Powell—I suppose he is the one, isn’t he?”
He thought it unbecoming that a judge should show
an intimate knowledge of the relations of young
men who were merely studying law.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, sir,” said Chad, maintaining his own dignity.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Everybody seems to speak well of him,” said
Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I can’t quite reconcile that with his selecting
Wade Powell as a preceptor. I would hardly
consider his influence the best in the world, and I
would imagine that Doctor Marley would hold to
the same opinion.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair spoke with a certain disappointment
in Doctor Marley. He had gone to hear him
preach once or twice, and found, as he said, an
intellectual quality in his utterances that he missed
in the sermons Mr. Hill had been preaching for
twenty years in the Presbyterian church.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Perhaps he doesn’t know Wade Powell,” said
Mrs. Blair. “Doctor Marley is comparatively a
stranger here, you know.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, I presume that explains it. But—” he
shook his head. He could not forgive any one who
showed respect for Wade Powell. “Powell has little
business except a certain criminal practice, and
now and then a personal injury case.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is there anything wrong in personal injury
cases?” asked Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge looked at his wife in surprise.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I suppose you know, don’t you,” he said,
“that such cases are taken on contingent fees?”
He spoke with the natural judicial contempt of the
poor litigant.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course, dear,” she replied, “I shall not undertake
to defend Mr. Powell. He’s a wild sort.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes; a drunkard, practically,” said Judge
Blair, “and an infidel besides. The moral environment
there is certainly not one for a young
man—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is he really an <em>infidel</em>?” asked Mrs. Blair,
abruptly dropping her knife and fork.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” replied the judge with the judicial affectation
of fairness, “he’s at least a free-thinker.
Perhaps agnostic were the better word. That is
one reason why I can not understand Doctor Marley’s
permitting his son to be associated with him.
It seems to me to argue a weakness, or a lack of
observation in the doctor, as it does a certain depravity
of taste in his son.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They discussed Marley until the meal was done,
and Connie and Chad had gone out of doors.
Judge Blair followed his wife into the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m worried, I’ll admit,” said the judge.
“What could it have been that so distressed her?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh well, the children’s little quarrels were too
much for her nerves.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They were silent and thoughtful, sitting together,
rocking gently in their chairs as the twilight stole
into the room.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s too bad he’s going to study law,” the judge
said after a while.</p>

<p class='c003'>He shook his gray head dubiously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But you always say that about any one who’s
going to study law,” Mrs. Blair argued. “You
even said it about George Halliday when his father
took him into partnership.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, it’s bad business nowadays unless a
young man wants to go to the city, and it’s hard
to get a foothold there.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But you began as a lawyer,” she urged, as
though he had finished as something else.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It was different in my day.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And you’ve always done well in the law,” Mrs.
Blair went on, ignoring his distinction.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh yes,” the judge said in a tone that expressed
a sense of individual exception. “But I went on
the bench just in time to save my bacon. There’s
no telling what might have become of us if I had remained
in the practice.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They were silent long enough for him to feel
the relief he had always found in his salaried position,
and then he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You don’t suppose—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, certainly not!” his wife hastened to assure
him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I think it would be well, perhaps, to
watch her closely. I don’t just like the notion.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But his father is—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, but after all, we really know nothing
about him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That is true.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And then Lavinia’s so young.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’d go to her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“After a while,” Mrs. Blair said.</p>

<p class='c003'>They heard steps on the veranda, and then the
voices of Mr. and Mrs. Chenowith who had run
across, as Mrs. Chenowith said, when Mrs. Blair
met them in the darkness that filled the wide hall,
to see how they all were. The Chenowiths begged
Mrs. Blair not to light the gas; they preferred
to sit out of doors. The Chenowiths remained all
the evening. When they had gone, the judge drew
the chairs indoors, while Mrs. Blair rolled up
the wide strip of red carpet that covered the steps
of the veranda. And when they had gone up to
their room, Mrs. Blair stole across to Lavinia,
softly closing the door behind her.</p>

<p class='c003'>She found the girl stretched on her bed, her face
buried in the pillows, which were wet with her
tears.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is troubling my little girl?” she asked.
She sat down on the side of the bed, and lightly
stroked Lavinia’s soft hair. The girl stirred, and
drew herself close to her mother. Mrs. Blair did
not speak, but continued to stroke her hair, and
waited. Presently Lavinia cried out:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, mama! mama!”</p>

<p class='c003'>And then she was in her mother’s arms, weeping
on her mother’s breast.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve never kept anything from you before,
mama,” Lavinia cried.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” Mrs. Blair whispered. “Can’t you tell
mama now?”</p>

<p class='c003'>And then with her mother’s arms about her Lavinia
told her all. When she had finished she
lay tranquilly. Mrs. Blair was relieved and yet
her troubles had but grown the more complicated.
She saw all the intricate elements with which she
would have to deal, and she quailed before them,
realizing what tact would be required of her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The coming of love should be a time of joy,
dear,” she said presently. Even in the darkness,
she could see the white blur of Lavinia’s face
change its expression. A smile had touched it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It should, shouldn’t it, mama?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I never kept anything from you before.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair laughed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But you kept this only a day, dear. That
doesn’t count.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It was a long day.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know, sweetheart.” The mother kissed her,
and they were silent a while.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I do love him so,” said Lavinia, presently.
“And you’ll love him too, mama, I know you will.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m sure of that, dear.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But what of papa?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair felt the girl grow tense in her arms.</p>

<p class='c003'>“That will all come right in time,” said Mrs.
Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Will you tell him?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Not just now, dear. We’ll have this for a little
secret of our own. There’s plenty of time. You
are young, you know, and so is Glenn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I love to hear you call him Glenn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair remained with Lavinia until she had
tucked her into her bed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just my little child,” the mother whispered
over the girl. “Just my little child.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, always that,” said Lavinia. And her
mother kissed her again and again, and left her in
the dark.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Mrs. Blair rejoined her husband, he laid
down the book he always read before retiring, and
looked up with the question in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She’s just a little nervous and tired,” Mrs.
Blair said. “She’ll be all right in the morning.
I think it best not to notice her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you think we’d better have Doctor Pierce
see her?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, not at all!” Mrs. Blair laughed, and the
judge, reassured, went back to his book.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were awakened from their first doze that
night by voices singing.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s some of the darkies from Gooseville,” said
Mrs. Blair. “They’re out serenading.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” said the judge. “It is sweet to fall
asleep by.”</p>

<p class='c003'>At the sound of the singing Lavinia had crept
from her bed and crouched in her white night-dress
before the open window; the shutters were closed.
She heard the melody from far down the street.
The singing ceased, then began again, drawing
nearer and nearer. Presently she heard the fall of
feet on the sidewalk before the house, and the low
tones of voices in hurried consultation. And then
a clear baritone voice rose, and she heard it begin
the song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh the sun shines bright in my old Kentucky home,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis summer, the darkies are gay.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>She knew the voice. Her heart swelled and the
tears came again and there alone in the fragrant
night she opened her arms and stretched them out
into the darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />LOVE’S ARREARS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The days following the picnic had been no
easier for Marley than they had been for
Lavinia. As he looked back on that night, a
fear took hold of him; the whole experience, the
most wonderful of his life, grew more and more unreal.
Much as he longed to see Lavinia again, he
was afraid to go to her home; he wondered whether
he should write her a note; perhaps she would
think him false, perhaps she would think he had
already forgotten her; the idea tormented him; he
did not know what to do. He had seen her but
once, and then at a distance; the Blairs’ well-known
surrey had stopped in the middle of the Square,
and George Halliday stood leaning into the carriage
chatting with Lavinia. Marley had but a
glimpse of Lavinia’s face, pink in the shadow of
the surrey-top. As they drove away she had
turned with a smile and a nod at Halliday. The
sight had affected Marley strangely.</p>

<p class='c003'>He felt himself so weak and incapable in this
affair that he longed to discuss it with some one,
and on Sunday afternoon he found his mother at
her window with the <em>Christian Advocate</em>, which
replaced, in her case, the nap nearly every one
else took at that hour.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How old was father when you were married,
mother?” he began.</p>

<p class='c003'>He spoke out of that curious ignorance of the
lives of their parents so common to children; he
had never been able to realize his parents as having
separate and independent existences before his
own. Mrs. Marley laid her paper by, and a smile
came to her face.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He was twenty-two,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just my age,” observed Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Marley looked up hastily.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’re not thinking of getting married, are
you, Glenn?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No.” he said with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c003'>“My goodness! You’re just a boy!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I’m as old as father was.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Y—es,” said Mrs. Marley, “but then—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But then, what?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That was different.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley smiled.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Had father entered the ministry yet?” he said
presently.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, we were married in his first year. He
had been teaching school, and the fall he was admitted
to the conference he was sent out to the
Gibsonburg circuit in Green County. We were
married in the spring.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Her face flushed, and she turned the pages of her
paper with a dreamy deliberation.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Ah, but your father was a handsome young
man, Glenn!” she said presently.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He’s handsome yet,” Marley replied with the
pride he always felt in his father. And then he
asked:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did he have any money?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” she said, and she laughed, “just a hundred
dollars!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“A hundred dollars! Well, he had nerve, didn’t
he? And so did you!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We had more than that,” said Mrs. Marley,
solemnly.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked at his mother suddenly. Her
face seemed for an instant to be transfigured in
the afternoon glow.</p>

<p class='c003'>He might have told her then; he was on the
point of it, but a footfall on the brick walk outside
caused him to look up, and he saw Lawrence
coming into the yard. Lawrence beckoned him and
he went out.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come on,” said Lawrence. “Let’s go out to
Carters’.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked a question at him, and the smile
which Lawrence never could repress long at a time
was twitching at the corners of his large mouth.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She’ll be there.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How do you know?” asked Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence smiled a little more significantly.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they got to the Carters’ they found Mayme
and Lavinia together in the yard, strolling about
in apparent aimlessness, yet with an expectancy
in their manner that belied its quality of mere idleness.
In the look Lavinia gave him all of Marley’s
perplexities vanished. Lawrence stood by with a
grin on his red face, and Mayme Carter’s eyes
danced. She and Lawrence assumed almost immediately
an elder, paternal manner, and looked on
at the lovers’ meeting as from far heights that
were to be reached only after all such youthful
experiences had long since become possible in retrospect
alone. Still smiling, they edged away, and
left the lovers alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is it really true?” Marley asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia colored a little as she smiled up at him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And you are happy?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“So happy!” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>And then all at once a cloud came over her eyes.
She closed them an instant.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is it?” he asked in alarm.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s nothing.” She was smiling again, as if to
show that her happiness was complete. “See?”
Her eyes were blinking rapidly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m glad,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>As they turned and walked across the yard Marley
looked at her nervously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you know,” he said, “that I couldn’t
remember what color your eyes were?” He spoke
with all the virtue there is in confession.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What color are they?” she asked, suddenly closing
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“They’re blue,” Marley replied, saying the word
ecstatically, as if it had a new, wonderful meaning
for him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Connie says they’re green.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Connie?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, don’t you know? She’s my younger sister.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh.” He did not know any of her family, and
the baffling sense of unreality came over him again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’ll know her,” said Lavinia, and added
thoughtfully: “I hope she’ll like you. Then there’s
Chad, my little brother.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was growing alarmed at the intricacies
of an introduction into a large family, the characters
of which were as yet like the characters in
the first few chapters of a novel, but he thought it
would not reflect on him to admit that he did not
know Chad, seeing that he was merely a little
brother.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He admires you immensely,” said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Does he?” said Marley, eagerly, instantly loving
Chad. “How does he know me?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He says you were a football player at college.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley laughed a modest deprecation of his own
prowess.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I knew your voice,” said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did you? When did you hear it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“As if you didn’t know!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Honestly,” he protested. “Tell me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, that night that you serenaded me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He was regretting that she had outdone him in
observation, but she suddenly looked up and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Glenn! What a beautiful voice you have!”</p>

<p class='c003'>It was the first time she had ever called him
Glenn, and it produced in him a wonderful sensation.</p>

<p class='c003'>They had come to a little bench, and, sitting
there, they could only look at each other and smile.
Marley noticed that a little line of freckles ran up
over the bridge of Lavinia’s nose. They were very
beautiful, he thought, and yet he had never heard
of freckles as one of the elements of a woman’s
beauty. Then he leaned back and looked about the
yard.</p>

<p class='c003'>He had always thought of it as it seemed that
first night, enormous, enchanted, with wide terraces
and fountains, and white statues gleaming
through the green shrubbery. But now he saw no
terraces, no statuary, no fountains, and no wide
lawns; nothing but a cramped little yard crowded
with bushes and trees, and surrounded by a weathered
fence that had lost several pickets. He looked
around behind the house where he had fancied long
stables with big iron lamps over the doors, but
now he saw nothing but an old woodshed and a
barn on the rear end of the lot. The cracks in the
barn were so wide that he could see the light of day
between them as through a kinetoscope. He heard
a horse stamping fretfully at the flies.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It was here,” he said, “that I first saw you.”
He did not speak his whole thought.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” she answered. “I remember.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That was a wonderful night, the most wonderful
of my life, except the one at the lake.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He drew close to her. “I loved you at first
sight,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did you?” She looked at him in reverence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,—from the very first moment. When you
came into the room, I knew that—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That you were the woman I had always loved
and waited for; that I had found my ideal. And
yet they say we never discover our ideals in this
life!”</p>

<p class='c003'>He laughed at this philosophical absurdity.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What did you think then?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>She cast down her eyes, and probed the turf
with the toe of her little shoe.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I loved you then too.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He gazed at her tenderly, rapturously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Isn’t it wonderful?” he said presently, “this
love of ours? It came to us all at once!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She looked at him suddenly. Her short upper
lip was raised.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It <em>was</em> love at first sight, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes. We were intended for each other.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They sat there, and went over that first night of
their meeting and that other night at Greenwood
Lake, finding each moment some new and remarkable
feature of their love, something that proved
its divine and providential quality, something that
convinced them that no one before had ever known
such a remarkable experience. They marveled at
the mystery of it.</p>

<p class='c003'>But at last they must return to practical questions,
and they resumed the account of their family
relations. Marley told Lavinia about his father
and mother, about his sister who had died, and then
about his grandparents, and his uncles and aunts.
He told her even of Dolly, behind whom she had
driven to Greenwood Lake, and of his father’s
love for fast horses, a love which sometimes drew
upon his father the criticism parishioners ever have
ready for their pastor. And he told her about his
home, and how frequently his mother had to entertain
transient ministers, and how the church laid
missionary work upon her, until he feared the
heathen would unwittingly break her down.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was not conscious of it, but he felt it necessary
to bring up all at once the arrears of her
knowledge of him and his family, of all his affairs.
Meeting as they had so strangely, so romantically,
and falling in love at first sight, according
to the prearrangement of the ages, they could
excuse this otherwise strange ignorance of each
other’s lives. They bemoaned all the years they
had been compelled to live without knowing each
other, and their one quarrel with fate was that
they had had to wait until so late in life before
meeting; and yet they finally consoled themselves
for this deprivation by discovering that they had
really always known and loved each other. They
were now able to compare strange experiences of
soul and, in the new light they possessed, to
identify them as communings of their spirits
across time and space.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve always believed somehow in the Sweden-borgians,”
Lavinia said, “but I never really understood
before what they meant by affinities.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They looked at each other in a silence that
became somber, and was broken at last by Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve told mama,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You have?” Marley gasped.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And she—?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“She was sweet about it. She will love you,
I know.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley felt a sudden love for Lavinia’s mother.
And then his fear returned at Lavinia’s sinister,</p>

<p class='c003'>“But—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But what?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“She says we must wait.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!” Marley said with a relief. He felt their
present happiness so great that he could afford
to waive any claim on the future. And yet he
was troubled; he felt that somehow a depression
lay on Lavinia. He wondered what its cause could
be. Presently it came to him suddenly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And your father?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He doesn’t know—yet.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Will he—?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He’s very—” she hesitated, not liking to seem
disloyal to her father. Finally she said “peculiar,”
and then further qualified it by adding
“sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The sadness that lies so near to the joy in lovers’
hearts came over them, and yet they found a kind
of joy in that too.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll go to him, of course,” Marley said presently.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, you’re so brave!”</p>

<p class='c003'>But this tribute did not tend to reassure Marley.
It rather suggested terrors he had not thought of.
Yet in the necessity of maintaining the manly
spirit he forced a laugh.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course,” he continued, “I’ll go to him. I
meant to from the first.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But not just yet,” she pleaded.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” he yielded, not at all unwillingly, “it
shall be as you say.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He could not dispel her sadness, nor could he
conquer his own. A little tremor ran through her,
and he felt it electrically along his arm.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is it, sweetheart?” he pleaded. “Tell
me, won’t you? We must have no secrets, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Glenn,” she broke out, “I’m afraid!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She spoke with intuitive apprehension.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of what?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Our happiness!”</p>

<p class='c003'>He tried to laugh again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you think it will ever be?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know it,” he said earnestly. “I have nothing
but faith—our love is strong enough for anything!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You comfort me,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia spent the night with Mayme Carter, and
the house sounded until long after midnight with
the low, monotonous drone of their confidential
voices.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />AN UNNECESSARY OPPOSITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley heard on Monday evening that Judge
Blair had gone to Cincinnati, and the news filled
him with a high if somewhat culpable joy. He
found Lavinia and her mother on the veranda,
and Lavinia said, with a grave simplicity:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Mama, this is Glenn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m very glad to have you come,” said Mrs.
Blair, trying instantly to rob the situation of the
embarrassment she felt it must have for the
young man.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley could not say a word, but he put all his
gratitude in the pressure he gave Mrs. Blair’s hand.
The light that came from the hall was dim, and
though Mrs. Blair could see that Marley was
straight and carried himself well, his face was
blurred by the shadows. She turned to Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Will you bring out another chair, dear, or
would you prefer to go indoors?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Then, seeing an advantage in this latter alternative,
she decided for them:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Perhaps we’d better go in, I fear it’s cool
out here.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She held back the screen door and Lavinia
whisked excitedly into the hall. Mrs. Blair led
the way to the parlor and sent Lavinia for a match.
Then, turning to Marley, waiting there in the darkness,
she said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“She has told me, Glenn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley felt something tender, maternal in her
voice; the way she spoke his name affected him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But she is young, very young; she is just a
girl. We wish, of course, for nothing but her happiness,
and you must be patient, very patient. It
must not be, if it is to be, for a long time. What
does your own mother think of it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I haven’t told her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You haven’t!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No. I felt I hardly had the right yet—not
before I spoke to Judge Blair, you know. I think
I shall speak to him just as soon as he gets home.”
He spoke impulsively; until that moment he had
been thrusting the thought from him, but Mrs.
Blair’s manner led him into confidences. In the
immediate fear that he had been precipitant, he
looked to her for help; she seemed the sort of woman
to wish to save others all the trouble she
could, one whose life was full of sacrifices, none
the less noble, perhaps, because she made so little
of them herself. But a perplexity showed in her
eyes and before she could reply, Lavinia was
back. With an intimate, domestic impulse Lavinia
pressed the match into Marley’s hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You do it; I can’t reach.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley groped with his upheld hand, and when
Lavinia guided him to the middle of the room, he
lighted the gas. Mrs. Blair looked at him for a moment
and Lavinia, standing by, as if awaiting her
decision, glowed with happiness. Mrs. Blair’s
smile completed the fond, maternal impression
Marley had somehow felt when she was standing
by him in the darkness. Her full matronly figure,
even in the tendency to corpulence of her middle
years, had preserved its graceful lines; and Marley
regretted the disappearance of this wholesome,
cheerful woman as she passed out of the room.</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair got home from Cincinnati on Sunday
morning, worn by his work, and maddened by
the din of the city to which he was so unaccustomed.
Walking up the familiar streets, he had been
glad of their shade and that pervading sense of a
Sunday that still remains a Sabbath in Macochee.
He had been a little piqued, at first, because his
wife had not met him at the train, though she
had not, to be sure, known that he was coming.
She had gone to Sunday-school, and Connie gave
him his breakfast—that is, she sat at the table
with him, watching him eat and answering the
questions he put to her about the happenings in
Macochee while he had been away.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was not strange that Connie should talk mostly,
after she yielded to the gnawing temptation to
tell him at all, of the nightly visits Marley had
made to the house. She did this in a certain resentment
she felt with Lavinia, a resentment that
came from an annoying jealousy she was beginning
to have of Marley, as if, in installing himself in
her sister’s heart, he had evicted all other affections
from it.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge, with his constant affectation of what
he considered the judicial attitude of mind, tried
to weigh Connie’s somewhat prejudiced evidence
impartially, but he was troubled and annoyed that
the peace he had been looking forward to all the
week should be jeopardized immediately on his
coming home.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was not until afternoon that he had an opportunity
to question his wife, and he began with a
severity in his attitude that had as its fundamental
cause, as much as anything else, her failure to
meet him at the train that morning, and her remaining
to church after Sunday-school.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What do you know about this business between
Lavinia and that young Marley?” he asked. “It
seems to have developed rapidly during my absence.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Connie has been talking to you, I suppose!”
laughed Mrs. Blair. “You know that Connie is
apt to be sensational.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair eyed his wife narrowly. Connie
was his favorite child, though he would not, of
course, admit as much, and he was ever ready to
spring to her defense.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She has very bright eyes,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, now, dear,” said Mrs. Blair, “don’t overestimate
this thing. Lavinia’s nothing but a child.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s just the point. Has the young man been
here much?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, he was here quite often—several evenings,
in fact.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Humph! He seems to have taken advantage of
the sunshine of my absence to make his hay.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t do him an injustice. He didn’t meet
Lavinia until just about the time you went away.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, we’ll see about it,” said the judge, darkly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now see here, Will, don’t make the matter serious
by an unnecessary opposition; don’t drive
the children into a position where they will consider
themselves persecuted lovers.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair had not until that instant thought of
this argument, and she was so pleased with it, as
justifying her own course with the children, as she
had artfully called them, that she pressed it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, don’t do that. Just let them alone. They’re
as likely as not to outgrow it; that is, if there is
anything between them to outgrow. They’ll probably
imagine themselves in love a dozen times before
either of them is married.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t talk of marriage!” said the judge, with
a little shudder.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair, who had so well dispelled her own
fears, could laugh at her husband’s.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just let them alone,” she said; “or leave it to
me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” said the judge peevishly, “leave it to
you. You’d probably aid and abet them.” And
then, instantly regretting his ill humor, he added
hastily: “You’re so kind-hearted.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair kissed his white hair gently and
gave his cheek a little pat.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’d better take a nap,” she said.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />A JUDICIAL DECISION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The judge refused to take a nap, though
when he sat down on the veranda he did take
one, lying back in his chair with one of the
many sections of the Sunday paper spread over
his face. It was from this somewhat undignified
posture that he was aroused by a step; he started
up hastily.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I beg your pardon,” said the young man, who
stood on the steps twirling his straw hat round and
round in his hands. The young man went on with
an anxious smile:</p>

<p class='c003'>“This is Judge Blair, I presume? My name is
Marley—Glenn Marley.”</p>

<p class='c003'>If Marley had known that there were men then
in the Ohio penitentiary serving terms that were
longer by years than they would have been had
Judge Blair digested his breakfast, or been allowed
to finish his afternoon nap, he would have chosen
another hour to press his suit. But he had youth’s
sublime confidence, and its abiding faith in the abstract
quality of justice. He had dreaded this
moment, but it had forced itself upon his keen
conscience as a duty, and when he heard that morning
that Judge Blair had returned he resolved to
have it out at once.</p>

<p class='c003'>“May I have a word with you?” he asked, advancing
a little.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge nodded, but slightly, as if it were
necessary for him, as a fattening man advanced in
middle life, to conserve his energies. His nod
seemed to include not only an assent, however reluctant,
but a permission as well, to take the other
chair that stood, all ready to rock comfortably, on
the veranda. Marley took the chair but he did not
rock, nor did he yield himself to it, but sat somewhat
tensely on its very edge.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s warm this afternoon, isn’t it?” he said, trying
to keep up his smile. He felt hopeless about it,
but the thought, darting through his mind, that Lavinia
was near, braced his purpose. The judge sat
hunched in his chair, with his short white hair
tumbled rather picturesquely, and his chin low in
his collar. His lips were set firmly, his brows contracted.
He breathed heavily, and on his strong
aquiline nose, Marley could see tiny drops of
perspiration.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have come,” said Marley, “to speak to you,
Judge Blair, on a matter of, that is, importance.
That is, I have come to ask you if I might—ah—pay
my addresses to your daughter.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley thought this form of putting it rather
fine, and he was glad that that much of it, at least,
was over. And yet, much as he liked this old-fashioned
formula about paying his addresses, he
instantly felt its inadequacy, and so nerved himself
to do it all over.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I mean Lavinia,” he said hurriedly, as if to
correct any error of identification he might have
led the judge into. “I want to marry her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge, still breathing heavily, looked at
Marley out of his narrowed eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You know,” Marley said, in an explanatory
way, “I love her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He waited then, but the judge was motionless,
even to the hand that hung at his side over the arm
of his chair, still holding his paper. Now and
then, at what seemed to be long, unequal intervals,
his eyelids fell slowly in heavy winks.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How long have you and Lavinia known each
other?” he asked finally.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I met her several weeks ago, out at Captain
Carter’s. But I did not see her again, that is to
speak to her, until about a week ago. In one way
I have known her, you might say, but a week; yet I
feel that I have known her a long time, always, in
fact. I—I—well, I loved her at first sight.” Marley
dropped his face at this speech, for it seemed
that he had made it too sentimental; he had a feeling
that the judge so regarded it. He sat and
picked at the braids of straw in his hat.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And have you spoken to her?” asked the judge.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh yes!” said Marley, looking up quickly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And she—?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“She loves me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge closed his eyes as if in pain. Then
he stirred, the paper dropped from his fingers, and
he drew himself up in his chair, as if to deal with
the matter.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How old are you, Mr. Marley?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am twenty-two,” said Marley, confidently, as
if this maturity must incline the judge in his favor.
“I cast my first vote for McKinley.” He
thought this, too, would help matters, and possibly
it did.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You have completed your education?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I graduated this summer from the Ohio Wesleyan.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And what are you doing now, or proposing to
do?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just now, I am studying law,” he announced.
“I’m going to make the law my profession.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked up with a high faith in this final
appeal, but even that did not impress the judge as
Marley felt a tribute thus delicately implied should
affect him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You are reading with a preceptor, I take it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, sir, in Mr. Powell’s office.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair looked at Marley as if he were deciding
what to do with him. After he had looked
a while he gazed off across the street, drumming
with his finger-tips on the arm of his chair. Presently,
without turning, and still gazing abstractedly
into the distance—and in that instant Marley remembered
that he had seen the judge stare at the
ceiling of the court room in exactly the same way
while sentencing a culprit—he began to speak.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia is yet very young, Mr. Marley,” he
said, “with no knowledge of the world, and, perhaps,
little of the state of her own mind. You too,
are young, very young, and as yet without an occupation.
You are, it is true, studying law, but it
will be three years before you can be admitted, and
many years after that before you can command a
practice that would warrant you in marrying. In
this day, the outlook for the young lawyer is not encouraging.
I do not think I would wish a son of
mine to choose that profession; the great changes
that have transpired, and are transpiring in our industrial
development, have greatly reduced the
chances of the young lawyer’s success. The practice
in the smaller county-seats, like our own, for
instance, has almost entirely vanished. The settlement
of titles to real estate, so lucrative a branch of
the law in the early days of my own practice, has
deprived the later practitioners of that source of
revenue; the field of criminal law has become
narrowed, unremunerative and almost disreputable.
The corporation work can be handled by one or two
firms in each town, and all that seems to be left is
the prosecution of personal injury suits, and that
is a work that hardly appeals to the man of dignity
and self-respect. The large cities have a wider, I
might say, the only field, but there the young lawyer
must spend years of the hardest, most unremitting
toil before he can come to anything like success.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge paused. He had not intended to
speak at such length, but the habit of the courts was
on him, and once started, he found his own didacticism
so pleasing to himself, that it was with reluctance
that he paused at all. He might not have
stopped when he did, but gone on almost indefinitely,
as he did when he delivered what were always
spoken of as his beautiful charges to juries,
had he not recalled, with something like a pang of
resentment, that the happiness of his own, instead
of another’s child, lay at the bottom of all this. He
turned then to face Marley. The young man was
sitting there, his eyes wide, and his face long. The
color that flamed in it when he first appeared, was
now quite gone. It was gray and cold instead.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You will see, Mr. Marley,” the judge resumed,
“that you are hardly in a position to ask for my
daughter’s hand. Of course,” the judge allowed a
smile to soften somewhat the fixity of his lips, “I
appreciate your manliness in coming to me, and I
do not want to be understood as making any reflections
upon, or in the least questioning, your character,
your worth, or the honor of your intentions.
But in view of your youth and of Lavinia’s, and in
view of your own, as yet, unsettled position in life,
you must see how impossible it is that anything like
an engagement should subsist between you. I say
this because I wish only for Lavinia’s happiness.
I may say that I am not unmindful of your happiness,
too, and I esteem it my duty to reach the conclusions
I have just presented to you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And I—I can not even see her?” stammered
Marley, in his despair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have not said that,” the judge said. “I shall
always be pleased to extend to you the hospitality
of my house, of course; but I would not consider it
necessary for you to see her regularly, or intimately,
and I certainly would not want you to
monopolize her society to the exclusion of other young
men with whom she has been in the habit of associating.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley sat there, after this long harangue, with
his head downcast. He sat and turned his hat round
and round. At last he did look up with an appeal
in his eyes, but when he saw that the judge was sitting
there, as he had at first, sunk in his chair,
breathing heavily and looking at him out of those
sluggish eyes, he arose. He stood a moment, and
looked off across the street somewhere, anywhere.
Then he smote one hand lightly into the other,
turned, and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well—good afternoon, Judge Blair.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Good afternoon, Mr. Marley,” the judge replied.
He watched Marley go down the walk and
out of the gate.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />A FILIAL REBUKE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Father!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair turned and saw Lavinia standing
in the wide front door. Her face was red, her
eyes were flashing, her arms hung straight and
tense at her sides.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge stirred uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!” she cried, rigidly clenching her little fists.
“What have you done! You have sent him away!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come here, my daughter,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia moved toward him, halting each moment,
then taking a few nervous steps forward.
At last she stood before him, challenging, defiant.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Sit down, Lavinia, and listen,” implored the
judge.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You have sent him away!” she repeated. “You
were harsh and cruel and unkind to him!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia!” cried the judge, flushing with the
anger parents call by different names. There was
now a peremptory quality in his tone. But the
girl did not heed him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, how could you!” she went on, “how could
you! Think how you must have wounded him!
You not only reproached him with being poor, but
you discouraged him as to his prospects! Do you
think I cared for that? Do you think I couldn’t
have waited? Do you think I can’t wait anyhow?
What had you when you proposed to mama? You
were poor—you had no prospects; you had no
more right—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia! Lavinia!” the judge commanded,
grasping the arms of his chair in an effort to rise.
“You are beside yourself! You don’t know what
you are saying!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And you pretended to be doing it all for my
happiness, too! Oh! oh! oh!” Her anger vented
itself impotently in these exclamations, and then
her mother, white and alarmed, appeared in the
doorway behind her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='c003'>The girl trembled violently, then whirled about,
pressed her hands to her face, and ran in, brushing
by her mother in the doorway. Mrs. Blair glanced
after her irresolutely. Then she went to her husband.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Be calm, dear,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge sank back in his chair and looked at
her in amazement.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What has happened?” She drew the empty
chair up and sat down in it. She leaned forward
and took one of his hands, and pressed it between
both of her own. She waited for the judge to
speak.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I hardly know,” he began. “I never heard Lavinia
break out so.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You must remember how excited and overwrought
she is,” Mrs. Blair exclaimed. “You must
make allowances.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I didn’t know the girl had such spirit,” he continued.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair smiled rather wanly, and stroked her
husband’s hand. It was very cold and moist, and
it trembled.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I had no idea it was so serious,” he went on, as
if summing up the catalogue of his surprises.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tell me how it all came about,” said Mrs.
Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Marley was here, first,” the judge began. He
had to pause, for he seemed to find it difficult to
catch his breath. “It was a great surprise to me;
it was very painful.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge withdrew his hand and wiped his
brow. Then he gazed again as he had done before,
across the street. Mrs. Blair, though eying him
closely and with concern, waited patiently.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I didn’t wish to wound him,” the judge resumed,
speaking as much to himself as to her. “I
hope I said nothing harsh; he really was quite
manly about it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He paused again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I presume I may have seemed cold, unfeeling,
unsympathetic,” he went on; and then as if he
needed to reassure and justify himself, he added,
“but of course it was impossible, utterly impossible.”</p>

<p class='c003'>After another pause, he drew a deep breath, and
as if he had already outlined his whole interview
with Marley, continued:</p>

<p class='c003'>“And then Lavinia appeared; she must have
heard it all, standing there in the hall.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge leaned heavily against the back of his
big chair; his face was drawn, his wrinkles were
deeper than they had been, and he wore an aspect
of weariness and pain. His form, too, seemed to
have shrunk, and he sat there in an almost helpless
mass, limp and inert.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am only afraid, dear,” Mrs. Blair said
quietly, “that we have taken this thing too seriously.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Possibly,” he said. “But it is serious, very
serious. I don’t know what is to be done.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We must have patience,” Mrs. Blair counseled.
“It will require all our delicacy and tact, now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Perhaps you had better go in to her,” the judge
said presently. “Poor little girl; she is passing
through the deep waters. And I tried to act only
for her interest and happiness.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair arose.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She will see that, dear, in time.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I hope so,” said the judge. Mrs. Blair went up
to Lavinia’s room, and listened for a moment at the
closed door. She heard a voice, low and indistinct,
but she knew it for the voice of Connie, and she
could tell from its tone that the little girl was trying
in her way to comfort and console her sister.
So she stepped away, silently, almost stealthily,
going on tiptoe.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge sat on the veranda all the afternoon.
He scarcely moved, and never once did he pick up
the Sunday paper. Now and then he bowed, in his
dignified way, to some acquaintance passing in the
street. The Chenowiths came out on to their front
porch, evidently hot and stupefied from their Sunday
afternoon naps and ready now for the cool refreshment
of the evening breeze they could usually
rely on in Macochee with the coming of the evening.
The judge bowed to them, and he tried to
put into his bow an indolent unconcern, lest the
Chenowiths should penetrate his manner and discover
the trouble that lay on his heart. The Chenowiths
had gone to the end of their porch, and the
judge could hear their laughter. He thought it
strange and unnatural that any one should laugh.</p>

<p class='c003'>He decided that he would review this whole affair
of Lavinia’s love calmly and judicially. He
went back to the beginning of Marley’s visit, trying
to see wherein he himself had been in the wrong,
then he went over the hot scene with Lavinia.
He could not recover from his surprise at this;
that Lavinia, who was usually so gentle, so mild,
so unselfish, should have given way to such anger
was incomprehensible. He had always said that
she had her mother’s disposition. He could see
her, all the time, distinctly, as she had stood there,
in a rage he had never known her to indulge before,
and yet, as he looked at the image of her that
was in his mind, and recalled certain expressions,
certain attitudes, certain tones of voice, it came
over him all at once that she was exactly as her
mother had been at her age, though he could not
reconcile Lavinia’s mood with the resemblance.
Then he went back to his own days of courtship,
with their emotions, their uncertainties, their
doubts and illusions. They seemed a long way off.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was trying to think calmly and logically,
but he found that he could not then control his
mind, for suddenly he saw Lavinia as a little girl,
with her mother kneeling before her, shaking out
and straightening her starched frock. And with
this thought came the revelation, sudden,
irresistible, that Lavinia was no longer a child as, with
the habit of the happy years, he had thought of
her, up to that very afternoon, in fact, until an
hour ago, and he bowed before the changes that
hour had wrought. He accepted the conviction
now that he himself had grown old. He forgot
his purpose to probe to its first cause this unhappiness
that had come to him; he saw that what he
mourned was the loss of a child, the loss of his
own youth.</p>

<p class='c003'>He glanced across at the Chenowiths again,
and they seemed remote from him, of another generation
in fact, though but a few moments before
he had looked on them as contemporaries. And
then suddenly there came to him the fear that Mr.
Chenowith might run over to chat with him, as was
his habit, and the judge hastily rose, and almost
surreptitiously went off the end of the porch and
around into the side yard. Under the new impression
of age that he had grown into, he walked
slowly, with a senile stoop, and dragged his feet
as he went. He wandered about in the yard for
a long while, looking at the shrubs and bushes and
trees he had planted himself so long ago, when he
was young. It occurred to him that here in this
garden he would potter around, and pass his declining
years.</p>

<p class='c003'>He remained in the yard until his wife came
to call him in to the supper she had prepared, in
the Sunday evening absence of the hired girl, and
with an effort he brought himself back from the
future to the present.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How is she?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, she’s all right,” said Mrs. Blair, in her
usual cheery tone. “I didn’t go to her, I thought
it best to leave her alone.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge looked at his wife, with her rosy
face, and her full figure still youthful in the simple
summer gown she wore. He looked at her curiously,
wondering why it was she seemed so young;
a width of years seemed all at once to separate
them. Mrs. Blair noted this look of her husband’s.
She noted it with pity for him; he looked older
to her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I think it would be nice for you to take Lavinia
with you when you go to Put-in-Bay to the
Bar Association meeting,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>It seemed strange and anomalous to Judge
Blair that he should still be attending Bar Association
meetings.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll see,” he said; and then he qualified, “if
I go.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“If you go?” his wife exclaimed. “Why,
you’re down for a paper!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“So I am,” said the judge.</p>

<p class='c003'>They turned toward the house, and the judge
took his wife’s arm, leaning rather heavily on it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Will!” she said, after they had gone a few
steps in this fashion. “What is the matter with
you! You walk like an old man!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She shook his arm off, and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hurry up now. The coffee will be getting
cold.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Indoors, they passed Connie going through the
hall; she had just come down the stairs, and the
sight of her girlish figure, and her short skirts
just sweeping the tops of her shoes, gladdened the
judge’s heart, and he smiled. He could rely on
Connie, anyway, for sympathy. But the girl
gave him a sharp reproachful stare from her dark
eyes, and the judge felt utterly deserted.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia did not come down to her supper,
though her mother, knowing she would want it
later, kept the coffee warm on the back of the
kitchen stove. Chad had gone away with one of
the Weston boys. So the three, the judge, Mrs.
Blair and Connie, ate their supper alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>After supper, Mrs. Blair and Connie went immediately
to Lavinia and the judge had a sense
of exclusion from the mysteries that were enacting
up there, an exclusion that seemed to proceed from
his own culpability. He went to his library and
tried to read, but he could only sit with his head
in his hand, and stare before him. But finally
he was aroused from his reveries by a stir in the
hall, and glancing up he saw Lavinia in the door.
She came straight to him, and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Forgive me, papa, if I was rude and unkind.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He seized her in his arms, hugging her head
against his shoulders, and he said again and again,
while stroking her hair clumsily:</p>

<p class='c003'>“My little girl! My little girl!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br />PUT-IN-BAY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The little steamer for the islands rolled out
of Sandusky Bay with Lavinia sitting by the
forward rail. She had yielded to her father’s
wishes with an easy complaisance that made
him suspicious, and yet, as he stood solicitously
by, he was persistent in his determination
to realize for her all the delights he had so
extravagantly predicted for the journey. He tried
to rouse her interest by pointing out Johnson’s
Island, but it did not possess for her, as the place
where the Confederate prisoners were confined during
the war, the interest an old soldier was able
to discover in it, and though he tried his best, with
an effort at entertainment that was well-nigh pathetic,
she only smiled wanly.</p>

<p class='c003'>He left her, after a while, her chin in her hands,
looking over into the light green waters, watching
the curve of the waves the steamer tossed away
from its sharp prow. The lake was in one of its
most smiling and happy moods, though they were
then at a point where storms easily lash its shallow
depths into billows that might satisfy the rage of
the North Atlantic. The lighthouse on the rocks
at Marblehead had a fascination for Lavinia; it
seemed waiting for her humor, and she watched it
until the steamer had gone far on toward Kelly’s
Island, and left the lighthouse behind, a white
spot gleaming in the sun.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they entered the little archipelago of
the Wine Islands, with their waters a deeper
green than those out in the lake and overcast in
strange ways by mysterious shadows and cool weird
reflections of the green of the islands all about,
Judge Blair came back to her and asked if she had
been seasick and how she had enjoyed the little
journey. As she met him with her strange perplexing
smile, he began to doubt her again; something
assured him that she still clung to her purpose
of love, and he found himself almost wishing
that she had kept to her defiant temper of the
Sunday afternoon that now seemed so far away.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they had reached Put-in-Bay and bounded
on the trolley across the island to the huge hotel,
they had their dinner and Lavinia perplexed the
judge further by retiring to her room. She said
she would rest, though she had persisted all the
morning that she was not tired.</p>

<p class='c003'>As soon as she had closed the door on her father,
leaving him in doubt and confusion, she began a
long letter to Marley. She described her trip in
detail, jealous of every trifle of experience that
had befallen her; she told him of the bridal
couple she had seen board the train at Clyde, and
of the showers of rice that had been thrown by
the laughing bridal party, though she omitted the
lone father of the bride standing apart on the
platform craning his head anxiously for another
sight of his daughter, and trying to smile. But
she gave him a sense of the romance that had
stirred in her at the sight of the lighthouse on
its lonely point of rocks and the stone towers that
made the wine-cellars on Kelly’s Island look like
castles.</p>

<p class='c003'>After supper Lavinia left her father to the
pleasure of renewing acquaintance with the lawyers
who thronged the lobby, and stole down to the rocks
that marked the shelving shore of the island. She
saw stately schooners, with white sails spread, and
she watched, until its black banner of smoke was
but a light wraith, a big propeller towing its convoy
of grain barges across the far horizon. This calm
serene passing of the life of the lakes soothed her,
filled her with a thousand fancies, and stirred her
emotions with deep, hidden hints of the mystery
of all life. As she sat there and gazed, now and
then tears came to her eyes. The waters were
spread smoothly before her under the last reflection
of the sun, the twilight was coming across the
lake; and as the light followed the sun and the
darkness crept behind, she looked toward the south
in the direction, as she felt, of Macochee, and
thought of her home and of her mother, of Connie
and of Chad, and then she thought of Glenn.</p>

<p class='c003'>Far out in the lake a cluster of yellow lights
moved swiftly along—one of the big passenger
steamers that nightly ply between Detroit and
Buffalo, and she read in that moving girdle of
light new meanings; then suddenly a fear seized
her, a fear that was part of the ache in her heart,
and she ran into the hotel and up to her room.
Then she took up her letter again and poured
out all her new sensations, her longings, and her
fears in a lengthy postscript. When she had
finished, she began to address the envelope; and
she wrote on it, with pride:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Mr. Glenn—”</p>

<p class='c003'>And then she paused. She did not know
whether he spelt his name “Marly,” or “Marley,”
or “Marlay.” She tried writing it each way,
dozens of times, but the oftener she tested it the
less able she was to decide. It was too ridiculous;
she became exasperated with herself; then humiliated
and ashamed. When she heard her
father’s step in the hall, she hastily locked her
letter in her little traveling bag. The judge
greeted her warmly; he was flushed and happy,
and in the highest spirits. During the afternoon
he had been meeting lawyers from all over Ohio;
the evening boats from Cleveland and Toledo had
brought more of them to the island; they were all
eminent, respectable, rich, the attorneys of big
corporations. The judges of the Supreme Court and
of the Circuit Courts were there, and the excitement
had reached its height when the boat from
Cleveland brought an associate justice of the United
States Supreme Court to deliver the chief
address of the meeting.</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair reveled in meeting all these distinguished
men; he enjoyed the flattery in
their way of addressing and introducing him.
But his conscience smote him when he saw Lavinia.
He drew up a chair and sat beside her, holding
his cigar at arm’s length. It was an excellent
cigar, better than he ordinarily smoked, and the
thin thread of smoke that wavered up from it
filled the room almost instantly with its delicate
perfume.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did my little girl think her father had deserted
her?” he said, speaking of her in the third person,
after the affectionate way of parents. “He must
pay better attention to her. She must come down
and meet the lawyers; they will be delighted; a
justice of the Supreme Court has just come on from
Washington! She will want to meet him!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge paused and twisted his head about for
a puff at his cigar, and then waited for Lavinia
to glow at the prospect. But when she looked at
him, and tried to smile again, he saw the glint of
tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why come, come, dear!” he said. “What’s
the matter? Aren’t you having a good time?
Never mind, when this meeting’s over we’ll go to
Detroit, and maybe up the lakes for a little trip.
That’ll bring the roses back!”</p>

<p class='c003'>He pinched her cheeks playfully, but she did
not respond; she looked at him pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, Lavinia,” he cried, “you aren’t homesick?”</p>

<p class='c003'>She winked bravely to stem the flood of tears
and then nodded.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well!” he said, nonplussed. “You know, dear,
we can’t—”</p>

<p class='c003'>The tears were brimming in her blue eyes, and
he left his sentence uncompleted to go on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“So you’re homesick, eh? For mama, and
Connie?”</p>

<p class='c003'>She nodded, and he studied her closely for a
moment, and then he could not resist the question
that all along had been torturing him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And for—?”</p>

<p class='c003'>She confirmed his fear, with quick decisive little
nods. She got out her handkerchief and hastily
brushed her tears away, and then with an effort to
control herself, she looked at him and said, as if
she were ready to have it all out then:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, father, I haven’t treated him right. I
came away without telling him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair scowled and turned away, and bit
the end of his cigar. Then he sat and studied it.
Lavinia waited; she was ready for the final contest.
Presently the judge arose.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, dear,” he said. “Well—we’ll see; of
course, we can’t go back just yet—I have my address
to read to-morrow, and besides, some of the
boys are talking of me for president of the Bar
Association. And I had thought, I had thought,
that a little trip over to Detroit, and maybe up to
Mackinac—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Father,” said Lavinia, looking at him now
calmly, “I don’t want to go to Detroit or up to
Mackinac. I’ll do, of course, as you say; I’ll wait
until the Bar meeting is over, but I want to go
home. You might as well know now, father—we
might as well understand each other—it can be
no other way.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Judge Blair looked at his daughter a moment,
and she kept her eyes directly and firmly in his.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh well,” he said with a sigh, “of course, dear,
if you say. I’d like to stay until after the election
though. Will you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course,” she consented.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />MACOCHEE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley had not learned of Lavinia’s departure
until Monday afternoon; he had the
news from Lawrence, who had it from the hackman
who had taken Judge Blair and Lavinia
to the train; for whenever any of the quality go
away from Macochee they always ride to the station
in the hack, though at other times they walk
without difficulty all over the town. When Marley
reached the office, and found Wade Powell, as
he usually found him, sitting with his feet on his
table, smoking and reading a Cincinnati paper,
the lawyer looked up casually, but when he saw
Marley’s expression he suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hello! What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley shook his head.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Something’s troubling you,” said Powell.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley shook his head again, and Powell looked
at him as at a witness he was cross-examining.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know better,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley affected to busy himself at his desk, but
after a while, he turned about and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Something is troubling me, Mr. Powell; my—prospects.”
He had been on the point of confessing
his real trouble, but with the very words
on his lips, he could not utter them, and so let
the conversation take another turn.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, prospects!” said Powell. “I can tell you
all about prospects; I’ve had more than any man
in Gordon County. When I was your age, opinion
was unanimous in this community that my prospects
were the most numerous and the most brilliant
of any one here!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell laughed, a little bitterly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“If I’d only been prudent enough to die then,
Glenn,” he went on, “I’d have been mourned as a
potential judge of the Supreme Court, senator
and president.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’ll be three years before I can be admitted,
won’t it?” asked Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” said Powell; “but that isn’t long; and
it isn’t anything to be admitted.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, it takes time, anyway,” said Marley,
“and then there’s the practice after that—how
long will that take?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, let’s see,” said Powell, plucking reflectively
at the flabby skin that hung between the
points of his collar. “Let’s see.” His brows were
twitching humorously. “It’s taken me about
thirty years—I don’t know how much longer it’ll
take.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell smoked on for a few moments, and then
added soberly:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course, I had to fool around in politics for
about twenty-five years, and save the people.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you think,” Marley said, after a moment’s
silence that paid its own respect to Powell’s regrets,
“that there’s an opening for me here in Macochee?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, Glenn, I’ll tell you. There’s no use to
think of locating in Macochee or any other small
town. The business is dead here. It’s too bad,
but it’s so. When I began there was plenty of
real estate law to do, and plenty of criminal law,
but the land titles are all settled now—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s what Judge Blair said,” interrupted
Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“So you’ve been to him, have you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley blushed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, not exactly,” he said. “I heard him
say that.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” mused Powell. “Well, he feathered his
nest pretty well while they were being settled.
But as I was saying—the criminal business has
died out, or rather, it has changed. The criminals
haven’t any money any more, that is, the old kind
of criminals; the corporations have it all now—if
you want to make money, you’ll have to have
them for clients. Of course, the money still goes
to the criminal lawyer just as it used to.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I like Macochee,” said Marley, his spirits
falling fast.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, it’s a nice old town to live in,” Powell
assented. “But the devil of it is how’re you going
to live? Of course, you can study here just as
well as anywhere; better than anywhere, in fact;
you have plenty of time, and plenty of quiet. But
as for locating here—why, it’s utterly out of the
question for a man who wants to make anything
of himself and has to get a living while he’s doing
it—and I don’t know any other kind that ever do
make anything out of themselves.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I had hoped—” persisted Marley, longing for
Powell to relent.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I know,” the lawyer replied almost impatiently,
“but it’s no use, there’s nothing in it.
No one with ambition can stay here now. The
town, like all these old county-seats, is good for
nothing but impecunious old age and cemeteries.
It was nothing but a country cross-roads before the
railroad came, and since then it’s been nothing but
a water-tank; if it keeps on it’ll be nothing but a
whistling-post, and the trains won’t be bothered
to stop at all. Its people are industrious in nothing
but gossip, and genuine in nothing but hypocrisy;
they are so mean that they hate themselves,
and think all the time they’re hating each other.
Just look at our leading citizen, Brother Dudley,
over there in his bank; he owns the whole town,
and he thinks he’s a bigger man than old Grant.
Sundays he sits in his pew with a black coat on,
squinting at the preacher out of his sore little eyes,
and waiting for him to say something he can get
the bishop to fire him for, and he calls that religion.
Mondays he goes back to his business of skinning
farmers and poor widows out of their miserable
little pennies, and he calls that business; Does he
ever look at a flower or a tree, or turn round in the
street at the laugh of a child? He’s the kind of
man that runs this town, and he makes the rest of
the people like it. Well, he don’t run me! God!
If I’d only had some sense twenty years ago I’d
have pulled out and gone to the city and been somebody
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c003'>It pained Marley to hear Powell berate Macochee;
he had never heard him rage so violently at
the town, though he was always sneering at it.
To Marley the very name of Macochee meant romance;
he liked the name the Indian village had
left behind when it vanished; he liked the old
high-gabled buildings about the Square; he longed
to identify himself with Macochee, to think of it
as his home.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I’ll tell you one thing,” Powell went on,
his tone suddenly changing to one of angry resolution
as he flung his feet heavily to the bare floor
and struck his desk a startling blow with his fist,
“I’ll tell you one thing, I’m through working for
nothing; they’ve got to pay me! I’m going to
squeeze the last cent out of them after this, same
as old Dudley does, same as old Bill Blair did before
he went on the bench; that’s what I’m going
to do. I’m getting old and I’ve got to quit running
a legal eleemosynary institution.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell’s eyes flamed, but a shadow fell in the
room, and Powell and Marley glanced at the door.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, what do you want?” said Powell.</p>

<p class='c003'>An old woman, bareheaded in the hurry of a
crisis, was on the threshold.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Mr. Powell,” she began in a wailing
voice, “would you come quick!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Charlie’s in ag’in.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Got any money?” demanded Powell, in the
angry resolution of a moment before. He clenched
his fist again on the edge of his table. Marley
glanced at him in surprise, and then at the old
woman.</p>

<p class='c003'>The woman hung her head and stammered:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, you know—I hain’t just now, but by the
week’s end, when I get the money for my
washin’—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Powell, getting to
his feet, “that’s all right. We won’t talk of that
now. I beg your pardon. We’ll walk down to
the calaboose and see the boy; we can talk it over
with him and see what’s to be done.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He picked up his slouch hat and clapped it on
his head.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’s he been doing this time?” he said to
the old woman as they went out the door.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley watched them as they passed the open
window and disappeared. A smile touched his
lips an instant, and then he became serious and
depressed once more.</p>

<p class='c003'>He had had no word from Lavinia, and her
going away immediately after his scene with
Judge Blair confused him. He tried to think it
out, but he could reach no conclusion save that it
was all at an end. Lavinia’s sudden, unexplained
departure proved that. And yet he could not, he
would not, think that she had changed; no, her
father had borne her away—that was it—forcibly
and cruelly borne her away. For a long while he
sat there finding a certain satisfaction in the melancholy
that came over him, and then suddenly he
was aroused by the boom of the town clock. The
heavy notes of the bell rolled across to him, and
he counted them—five. It was time to go. And
Powell had not returned. It was not surprising;
Powell often went out that way and did not come
back, and, often, somehow to Marley’s chagrin,
men and women sat and waited long hours in the
dumb patience of the poor and then went away
with their woes still burdening them. They must
have been used to woes, they carried them so silently.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was walking moodily down Main Street,
feeling that he had no part in the bustling happiness
of the people going home from their day’s
work, when, lifting his head, he saw Mrs. Blair in
her surrey. Instantly she jerked the horse in
toward the curb and beckoned to him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, Glenn! I’m so glad I met you!” she
said, her face rosy with its smile. “I have something
for you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She raised her eyebrows in a significant way
and began fumbling in her lap. Presently she
leaned out of the surrey and pressed something
into his hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just between ourselves, you know!” she said,
with the delicious mystery of a secret, and then
gathering up her reins, she clucked at her lazy
horse.</p>

<p class='c003'>He looked after her a moment, then at the
thick envelope he held in his hand. On it was
written in the long Anglican characters of a young

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />A CONDITIONAL SURRENDER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Judge Blair and Lavinia returned home Saturday.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I guess it’s no use,” the judge said to Mrs.
Blair when she had followed him up stairs, where
he had gone to wash off the dust he had accumulated
during the six hours the train had consumed
in jerking itself from Sandusky to Macochee.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I could see how relieved she was to get
home,” replied Mrs. Blair, musing idly out of the
window. She was not so sure that she was pleased
with the result she had done her part to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I guess you were right,” the judge said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I?” asked Mrs. Blair, suddenly turning round.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes—in saying that it would be best not to dignify
it by too much notice. That might only add
to its seriousness.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair looked out of the window again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course,” the judge went on presently, “I
wouldn’t want it considered as an engagement.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course not,” Mrs. Blair acquiesced.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’d better have a talk with her,” he said.
She saw that he was seeking his usual retreat in
such cases, and she was now determined not to take
the responsibility. Spiritually they tossed this
responsibility back and forth between them, like
a shuttlecock.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But wouldn’t that make it look as if we were
taking too much notice of it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” the judge said, “I don’t know. Do
just as you think best.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Didn’t you talk to her about it when you were
away?” Mrs. Blair asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“M-m yes,” the judge said slowly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And what did she say?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nothing much, only—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Only what?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Only that she would not give him up.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair waited, and the judge dawdled at his
toilet. Some compulsion she could not resist,
though she tried, distrusting her own weakness,
drove Mrs. Blair to speak first, and even then she
sought to minimize the effect of her surrender.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course, Will,” she said, “I want to be
guided by you in this matter. It’s really quite serious.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, well,” he said, “you’re capable of managing
it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You said you knew his father, didn’t you?”
she asked after a while.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Slightly; why?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I was just wishing that we knew more of the
family. You know they have not lived in Macochee
long.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s true,” the judge assented, realizing all
that the objection meant.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And yet,” Mrs. Blair reassured him, though
she was trying to reassure herself at the same time,
“his father is a minister; that ought to count for
something.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, it ought, and still you know they say that
ministers’ sons are always—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But,” Mrs. Blair interrupted, as if he were
wholly missing the point, “ministers’ families always
have a standing, I think.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They were silent, then, until Mrs. Blair began:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I suppose I really ought to call on Mrs. Marley.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, it seems, you know—it seems to me that
I ought.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But wouldn’t that—?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I considered that, and still, it might seem more
so if I didn’t, don’t you see?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge tried to grasp the attenuated point,
and expressed his failure in the sigh with which he
stooped to fasten his shoes. Then he drew on his
alpaca coat, and just as he was leaving the room,
his wife stopped him with:</p>

<p class='c003'>“But, Will!”</p>

<p class='c003'>He halted with his hand on the door-knob. For
an instant his wife looked at him in pleasure. He
was rather handsome, with his white hair combed
gravely, his ruddy face fresh from his shaving,
and his stiff, white collar about his neck.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What did you say?” he asked, recalling her
from her reverie of him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!” she said; “only this—maybe he won’t
feel like coming around here any more. You
know you practically sent him away.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge gave a little laugh.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I guess that will work itself out. Anyway I’ll
leave it to you—or to them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Still smiling at his own humor, he turned the
door-knob, and then hesitated. His smile had
vanished.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She’s so young,” he said with a regret. “She’s
so young. How old did you say you were when we
were married?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Eighteen,” Mrs. Blair replied.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And Lavinia can’t be more than—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, she’s twenty,” said Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“So she is,” said the judge. “So she is. But
then you—”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair had come close to him, and stood
picking a bit of thread from his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It was different with us, wasn’t it, dear?”
she said, looking up at him.</p>

<p class='c003'>He kissed her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />SUMMER</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The dust lay thick in Ward Street, sifting
its fine powder on the leaves of the cottonwoods
that grew at the weedy gutter. The
grass in the yard grew long, and the bushes languished
in the heat. Judge Blair’s beans clambered
up their poles and turned white; and Connie’s
sweet peas grew lush and rank, running,
as she complained, mostly to leaves. The house
seemed to have withdrawn within itself; its green
shutters were closed. In the evening dim figures
could be seen on the veranda, and the drone of
voices could be heard. At eleven o’clock, the deep
siren of the Limited could be heard, as it rounded
the curve a mile out of town. After that it was
still, and night lay on Macochee, soft, vast, immeasurable.
The clock in the Court House tower
boomed out the heavy hours. Sometimes the harmonies
of the singing negroes were borne over the
town.</p>

<p class='c003'>And to Marley and Lavinia those days, and
those evenings of purple shadows and soft brilliant
stars, were but the setting of a dream that unfolded
new wonders constantly. They were but a part of
all life, a part of the glowing summer itself, innocent
of the thousand artificial demands man has
made on himself. Lavinia went about with a new
expression, exalted, expectant; a new dignity had
come to her and a new beauty; all at once, suddenly,
as it were, character had set its noble mark
upon her, and about her slender figure there was
the aureola of romance.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Have you noticed Lavinia?” Mrs. Blair asked
her husband.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, why?” he said, in the alarm that was ever
ready to spring within him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She has changed so; she has grown so beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c003'>One morning the judge saw a spar of light flash
from her finger, and he peered anxiously over his
glasses.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’s that, Lavinia?” he asked, and when she
stood at his knee, almost like a little girl again
in all but spirit, he took her finger.</p>

<p class='c003'>“A ring,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Glenn gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Glenn?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I thought there was to be no engagement?”
The judge looked up, as if there had been betrayal.
But Lavinia only smiled. The judge
looked at her a moment, then released her hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I wouldn’t wear it where any one could see it,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>The summer stretched itself long into September;
and then came the still days of fall, moving
slowly by in majestic procession. With the first
cool air, a new restless energy awoke in Marley.
All the summer he had neglected his
studies; but now a change was working in him as
wonderful as that which autumn was working in
the world. He looked back at that happy, self-sufficient
summer, and, for an instant, he had a
wild, impotent desire to detain it, to hold it, to
keep things just as they were; but the summer was
gone, the winter at hand, and he felt all at once
the impact of practical life. He faced the future,
and for an instant he recoiled.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia was standing looking up at him. She
laid her hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is it, Glenn?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I was just thinking,” he said, “that I have a
great assurance in asking you to marry me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, dear, just this: I can’t get a practice in
Macochee; I might as well look it in the face now
as any time. I have known it all along, but I’ve
kept it from you, and I’ve tried to keep it from
myself. There’s no place here for me; everybody
says so, your father, Wade Powell, everybody.
There’s no chance for a young man in the
law in these small towns. I’ve tried to make myself
think otherwise. I’ve tried to make myself believe
that after I’d been admitted I could settle
down here and get a practice and we could have a
little home of our own—but—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Can’t we?” Lavinia whispered the words, as if
she were afraid utterance would confirm the fear
they imported.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well—that’s what they all say,” Marley insisted.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But papa’s always talking that way,” Lavinia
protested. “I suppose all old men do. They forget
that they were ever young, and I don’t see
what right they have to destroy your faith, your
confidence, or the confidence of any young man!”
Lavinia blazed out these words indignantly. It
was consoling to Marley to hear them, he liked her
passionate partizanship in his cause. He longed
for her to go on, and he waited, anxious to be reassured
in spite of himself. He could see her
face dimly in the starlight, and feel her figure rigid
with protest beside him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s simply wicked in them,” she said presently.
“I don’t care what they say. We can and we will!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I like to have you put it that way, dear,” said
Marley. “I like to have you say ‘we’!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She drew more closely to him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And you think we can?” he said presently.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And have a little home, here, in one of these
quiet streets, with the shade, and the happiness—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And it wouldn’t matter much if we were poor?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just at first, you know. I’d work hard, and we
could be so happy, so happy, just we two, together!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, yes,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I love Macochee so,” Marley said presently. “I
just couldn’t leave it!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t! Don’t!” she protested. “Don’t even
speak of it!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />ONE SUNDAY MORNING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was Sunday morning and Marley sat in
church looking at a shaft of soft light that fell
through one of the tall windows. From gazing at
the shaft of light, he began to study the symbols
in the different windows, the cross and crown, the
lamb, the triangle that represented the Trinity, all
the Roman symbols that Protestantism still retains
in its decorations. Then he counted the pipes in
the organ, back and forth, never certain that he
had counted them correctly. All about him the
people were going through the service, but it had
lost all meaning for Marley, because he had been
accustomed to it from childhood.</p>

<p class='c003'>Having been reassured by Lavinia, he felt that
he should be happy, yet a strong sense of dissatisfaction,
of uncertainty, flowed persistently under
all his thoughts, belying his heart’s assurance of
its happiness. When Doctor Marley, advancing
to the pulpit, buttoned his coat down before him,
pushed aside the vase of flowers the ladies’ committee
always put in his way, and stood with his
strong, expressive hand laid on the open Bible,
Marley’s thoughts fixed themselves for a moment in
the pride and love he had always had for his father.
There swept before him hundreds of scenes like this
when his father had stood up to preach, and then
suddenly he realized that his father had grown old:
he was white-haired and in his rugged, smooth-shaven
face deep lines were drawn—the lines of a
beautiful character.</p>

<p class='c003'>He remembered something his father had said to
the effect that the pulpit was the only place in
which inexperienced youth was desired, showing
the insincerity of what people call their religion,
and then he remembered the ambitions he
had dimly felt in his father in his earlier days; it
had been predicted that his father would be a
bishop. But he was not a bishop, and now in all
probability never would be one; he was not politician
enough for that. And Marley wondered
whether or not his father could be said to have
been successful; he had come to know and to do
high things, he had lived a life full of noble sacrifice
and the finest faith in humanity and in God;
but was this success? He heard his father’s voice:</p>

<p class='c003'>“The text will be found in the third chapter
of the Lamentations of Jeremiah.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But Marley never listened to sermons; now and
then he caught a phrase, or a period, especially
when his father raised his voice, but his thoughts
were elsewhere, anywhere—not on the sermon.
The men and women sitting in front of him kept
shifting constantly, and he grew tired of slipping
this way and that and craning his neck in order to
see his father. And then the constant fluttering of
fans hurt his eyes, and they wandered here and
there, each person they lighted on suggesting some
new train of thought.</p>

<p class='c003'>Presently they fell on a girl in a white dress, and
in some way she suggested Lavinia. And instantly
he felt that he should be perfectly happy when
thinking of Lavinia, but, as suddenly, came that
subconscious uncertainty, that deep-flowing discontent.
He went over his last conversation with
Lavinia, in which he had found such assurance,
but now away from her he realized that he had
lulled himself into a sense of security that was all
false; and the conviction that Macochee had no
place for him, at least as a lawyer, came back.
He tried to put it away from him, and think of
something else.</p>

<p class='c003'>His eyes fell on old Selah Dudley, sitting like all
pillars of the church, at the end of his pew. Dudley’s
back was narrow, and rounded out between
the shoulders so that Marley wondered how he
could sit comfortably at all; his head was flat and
sheer behind, and Marley could see with what care
the old banker had plastered the scant hair across
his bald poll—the only sign of vanity revealed in
him, unless it were in the brown kid gloves
he wore. Marley looked at Dudley with the feeling
that he was looking at the most successful man
in Macochee, and yet he had a troubled sense of
the phariseeism that is the essential element of
such success. He remembered what Wade Powell
had said; immediately he saw Dudley in a new
light; the old man sat stolid, patient and brutal,
waiting for some heterodoxy, or something that
could be construed as heterodoxy, theological or
economic, like a savage with a spear waiting to
pierce his prey, and glad when the moment came.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Marley, seeing the young girl in the white
dress, again thought of Lavinia, who would be sitting
at that very moment with her father and
mother and Connie and Chad over in the Presbyterian
church. How long would it be before he could
sit there beside her, as her husband? Then with
a flash it came to him that they would, in all
likelihood, be married in that very church. Instantly
he saw the spectators gathered, he saw the
pulpit and the chancel-rail hidden in flowers, he
saw his father with his ritual in his hands, waiting;
and then while the organ played the wedding
march, Lavinia coming down the aisle, her eyes
lowered under her veil. His heart beat faster, he
felt a wave of emotion, joyous, exciting.</p>

<p class='c003'>But there was much to do before that moment
could come—the long days and nights of study; the
examination looming like a mountain of difficulties,
then months and years of waiting for a practice.
He tried to imagine each detail of the coming of
a practice, but he could not; he could not conceive
how it was possible for a practice to come to any
one, much less to him. There were many lawyers
in Macochee now, and all of them were more or
less idle. There was certainly no need of more.
Judge Blair and Wade Powell and every one
had told him that, and suddenly he felt an impatience
with them all, as if they were responsible
for the conditions they described; they all conspired
against him, men and conditions, making
up the elements of a harsh, intractable fate.</p>

<p class='c003'>And Marley grew bitter against every one in
Macochee; they all gossiped about him, they were
all determined to drive him away; well, let them;
he would go; but he would come back again some
day as a great, successful lawyer, looking down on
them and their little interests, and they would be
filled with envy and respect. But what of Lavinia?</p>

<p class='c003'>What right had he to ask her to marry him?
What right had he to place her in the position he
had? He realized it now, clearly, he told himself,
for the first time. She had given up all for
him. She would go out no more, she had foregone
her parties, calls, picnics, dances, everything; in
her devotion she had estranged her friends. He
had given her parents concern, he had placed her
in a false, impossible position. He must rescue
her from it. But how? By breaking the engagement?
He blushed for the thought. By going
away quietly, silently, without a word? That
would only increase the difficulty of her position.
By keeping her waiting, year after year, until he
could find a foothold in the world? Even that
was unfair.</p>

<p class='c003'>No, he could not give up Lavinia and he could
not go away from Macochee, hence it followed that
he must give up the law. He must get some work
to do, and at once; something that would pay him
enough to support a wife. He began to canvass
the possibilities in Macochee. He thought of all
the openings; surely there would be something;
there were several thousand persons in Macochee,
and they lived somehow. He did not wish to give
up the law; not that he loved it so, but because he
disliked to own himself beaten. But it was necessary;
he could suffer this defeat; he could make
this sacrifice. There was something almost noble
in the attitude, and he derived a kind of morbid
consolation from the thought.</p>

<p class='c003'>His father was closing the Bible—sure sign that
the sermon was about to end. There was another
prayer, then a hymn, and while the congregation
remained standing for the benediction, he heard
his father’s voice:</p>

<p class='c003'>“The peace of God which passeth all understanding—”</p>

<p class='c003'>The words had always comforted him in the sorrows
he was constantly imagining, but now they
brought no peace.</p>

<p class='c003'>In another moment the congregation was stirring
joyously, in unconscious relief that the sitting
was over. The hum of voices assumed a pleasant
social air, as friend and acquaintance turned to
greet one another. The people moved slowly down
the aisle. He caught a glimpse of his father,
smiling and happy—happy that his work was done—passing
his handkerchief over his reddened brow
and bending to take the hands of those who came
to speak to him and to congratulate him. Just then
Selah Dudley gave his father his hand; the sight
pleased Marley; and suddenly an idea came to him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />A SAINT’S ADVICE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>On Monday morning Marley found Dudley
at his post in the First National Bank. He
halted at the little low gate in the rail that
ran round Dudley’s desk until Dudley looked
up and saw him, and then Marley smiled.
Dudley, conceiving it to be the propitiatory smile
of the intending borrower, narrowed his eyes as
he regarded him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well?” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley went in and sat down on the edge of the
hard chair that was placed near Dudley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I wish to have a little talk with you, Mr. Dudley,”
he said. He waited then for Dudley to reply,
thinking perhaps he would be interested in the
son of his pastor. Dudley had turned his chair a
little, and seemed to have sunk a little lower in its
brown leather cushions, worn to a hard shine during
the long years he had sat there. The lower part
of him was round and full and heavy, while his
shoulders were narrow and sloping, and his chest
sunken, as if, from sitting there so many years,
his vitals had settled, giving him the figure of a
half emptied bag of grain. His legs were thin, and
his trousers crept constantly up the legs of the boots
he wore; the boots were blackened as far as the
ankles, above the ankles they were wrinkled and
scuffed to a dirty brown.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley noted these details hurriedly, for it was
the face of the man that held him. A scant beard,
made up of a few harsh, wiry hairs, partly covered
the banker’s cheeks and chin; his upper lip was
clean-shaven, and his hair, scant but still black,
was combed forward at the temples, and carefully
carried over from one side of his head to the other,
ineffectually trying to hide the encroaching baldness.
His nose was large; his eyes narrow under
his almost barren brows and red at the edges of
the lids that lacked lashes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What do you want?” said Dudley, never moving,
as if to economize his energies, as he
economized his words and every other thing of value in
his narrow world.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley did not know just what reply to make:
this was a critical moment to him, and he must
make no mistake.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I came,” he began, “to—to ask you for a little
advice.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Dudley, at this, settled a little more into his
chair, possibly a little more comfortably; he seemed
to relax somewhat, and his eyes were not quite
so narrow as they had been. But he blinked
a moment, and then cautiously asked:</p>

<p class='c003'>“What about?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, it’s just this,” Marley began, smiling
persistently; “you see I’ve begun the study of law;
I had intended to be a lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We’ve got plenty o’ lawyers,” said Dudley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s just the conclusion I have come to, and
I was thinking somewhat of making a change.
And so I thought I’d come and ask you, that is,
your advice.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Dudley, still cautious, made no reply, and Marley
almost despaired of getting on easy terms. He
began to wish he had not come; he might have
known this, he said to himself, and his smile and
the confidence with which he had come began to
leave him. But he must make another effort.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You see, Mr. Dudley,” he said, “I thought,
as things are nowadays, I would have to wait years
before I could really do anything in the law, and
as I have my own way to make in the world, I
thought, you know, I might get into something
else.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What, for instance?” asked Dudley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I didn’t exactly know; I had hardly
thought it out,—that’s why I came to you, knowing
you to be a man of large affairs.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Dudley had an instant’s vision of his bank, of
his stocks, and of the many farms all over Gordon
County on which he held mortgages, but he checked
his impulse; these very possessions must be guarded;
people envied him them, and while this envy
in one way was among the sources of his few joys,
it nevertheless gave rise to covetousness which was
prohibited by the tenth commandment.</p>

<p class='c003'>“So you want my advice, eh?” he asked, looking
hard at Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And that’s all?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well—any suggestions,” Marley said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Dudley still hesitated. He continued to study
Marley out of his little eyes. Presently he inquired,
as if by way of getting a basis to start on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You been to college, ain’t you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, sir,” Marley answered promptly; “I graduated
in June.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How long was you there?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why,” Marley replied in some surprise, “the
full four years.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Four years,” Dudley repeated. “How old?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Twenty-two.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, that’s that much time wasted. If a young
man’s going to get along these times, and make
anything of himself, he has to start early, learn
business ways and habits. He’s got to begin at
the bottom, and feel his way up.” The banker was
speaking now with a reckless waste of words that
was surprising. “The main thing at first is to
work; it ain’t the money. Now, when I come to
Macochee, forty-seven years ago, I hadn’t nothing.
But I went to work, I was up early, and I
went to bed early; I worked hard all day, I ’tended
to business, and I saved my money. That’s it,
young man, that’s the only way—up early, work
hard, and save your money.” Dudley leaned back
in his chair to let Marley contemplate him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But what did you work at? At first, I mean.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why,” said Dudley, as if in surprise, “at anything
I could get. I wan’t proud; I wan’t ’fraid
o’ work.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley leaned forward with his elbows on his
knees and began twirling his hat in his hands.
Then, thinking the attitude lacking in respect, he
sat up again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then, I was careful of my habits,” Dudley
went on. “I never touched a bit o’ tobacco, nor
tasted a drop o’ liquor in my life.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He paused, and then:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you use tobacco?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Sometimes,” Marley hesitated to confess.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Cigarettes?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now and then.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Humph! Learned that at college, I suppose.”
Marley made no reply.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, you’ve started wrong, young man. That
wan’t the way I made myself. I never touched a
drop of liquor nor tasted tobacco. I worked hard
and God prospered me—yes, God prospered me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Dudley’s voice sank piously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now, I’ll tell you.” He seemed to be about to
impart the secret of it all. “When I was your
age, I embraced religion, and I promised God
that if he’d prosper me I’d give a tenth of all I
made to the church; a tenth, yes, sir, a full tenth.”
The banker paused again as if making a calculation,
and a trouble gathered for an instant at his
hairless brows, but, as if by an effort, he smoothed
them so that they became meek and submissive.
And then he went on, as if he had found a species
of relief:</p>

<p class='c003'>“But it was the best bargain I ever made. It
paid; yes, it paid; I kep’ my word, and the Lord
kep’ His; He prospered me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He had folded his hands, and sat blinking at
Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“So my advice to you, young man, is to give up
tobacco and all your other bad habits, to be up early
in the morning, to work hard, and remember God
in all your ways, and He shall direct thy paths.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Dudley stirred, and moved his swivel chair a
little, as if it were time to resume work. But Marley
sat there.</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s my advice to you, young man,” Dudley
repeated, “and it won’t cost you a cent.” He said
this generously, at the same time implying a hint
of dismissal. Still Marley did not move, and Dudley
eyed him in some concern. Marley saw the
look and forced a smile.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I thank you, Mr. Dudley,” he said, “for your
advice. I am sure it is good. I was wondering,
though,” he went on, with a reluctance that he knew
impaired the effect of his words, “if you wouldn’t
have something here in your bank for me—”</p>

<p class='c003'>At this Dudley suddenly seemed to shrink in
size. His eyes became small, mere inflamed slits
beneath his hairless brows, and he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I thought you said you wanted advice?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I did,” Marley explained, “but I thought
maybe—”</p>

<p class='c003'>He did not finish the sentence. He rose and
stood, still twirling his hat in his hand. “And
you have nothing, you know of nothing?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Dudley slowly shook his head from side to side,
once or twice, having resumed his economical
habits.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Good morning,” Marley said, and left.</p>

<p class='c003'>As he went out, the cashier and the assistant
cashier looked at him through the green wire
screen. Then they lifted their heads from their
tasks cautiously and exchanged surreptitious
glances.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />LOVE AND A LIVING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley was not surprised by the result of
his visit to Selah Dudley. He made an effort
to convince himself that there was truth in
what Dudley had said to him, even if he could
not remember exactly what it was that Dudley
had said. He tried to put down the instinctive feeling
of dislike he had for the old banker; he told
himself that such a feeling was unworthy of him,
if not unworthy of Dudley, and in thinking the
matter over he tried to clear himself of all suspicion
of envy or jealousy of Dudley’s success. The whole
town considered Dudley its leading man, and
Marley tried so to consider him; and he tried to
consider him in this light because he was a good
man and not because he was a rich man, just as
the town pretended to do. He wanted to talk about
Dudley with some one, but he did not want to talk
about him with Lavinia, because he felt a shame in
his failure with Dudley that he feared Lavinia
might share. He did talk with his father about
him, but his father did not seem to be interested;
he smiled his tolerant smile, but made no comment.
And when Marley pressed him for an opinion
of Dudley his father said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“They make broad their phylacteries.”</p>

<p class='c003'>And that was all.</p>

<p class='c003'>However, Marley found Wade Powell willing
to talk of Selah Dudley, as he was willing to talk of
almost anything. Marley did not tell Powell that
he had been to Dudley to ask for a position; he
merely let it be understood that he had met the
old man in the course of the day and talked with
him casually.</p>

<p class='c003'>“By the way,” he asked, as if the thought had
just come to him, “how did Selah Dudley make his
money?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He didn’t make it,” Powell answered.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He didn’t? Did he inherit it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then how did he get it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He gathered it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Gathered it? I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell laughed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You don’t? Well, there’s a difference.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He wasn’t in the army, was he?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“In the army! Great God!” Powell threw into
his voice the contempt he could not find the word
to express. “You think he’d risk his hide in
the army? Well, I should say not! Though
he would have been perfectly safe—” Powell said
it as a parenthetical afterthought—“no bullet could
ever have pierced his hide, and he had no blood to
shed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell bit the end from his cigar and spat out
the damp little pieces of tobacco viciously.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I’ll tell you, Glenn,” he said, “he stayed
at home and got his start, as he calls it, by skinning
the poor. Widows were his big game and he
gathered a little pile that has been growing ever
since. To-day he owns Gordon County.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He seems to be a prominent man in the church,”
ventured Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He’ll be a prominent man in hell,” said Powell,
angrily. And then he added thoughtfully: “My
one regret in going there myself is that I’ll have to
see him every day.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The most curious effect of Marley’s visit to Dudley,
however, was one he did not observe himself.
Having been defeated in his plan to secure a place
in the bank, he felt at first, with a certain consolation,
that he still had the law to fall back on, and
he returned to his studies. But he made little headway;
once having decided to give up the law, the
decision remained, and his mind was constantly
occupied with schemes for securing a foothold in
some other occupation. He considered, one after
another, every possibility in Macochee, and as fast
as he thought of some opening, he went for it, but
invariably to find it either no opening at all, or
else, if it were an opening, one that closed at his
approach. Gradually he gave up his studies altogether,
and sat idle, his book before him; but one
day Powell said to him:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Say, Glenn, you’re not getting along very fast,
are you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley started, and flushed with a sense of guilt.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, no,” he admitted.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’s the matter, in love?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley blushed, from another cause this time,
though the guilt remained in his face. But Powell
instantly was gentle.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I beg your pardon,” he said, “I was just joking,
of course; I didn’t mean to be inquisitive. You
mustn’t mind my boorishness.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked at him gratefully and Powell, to
whom any show of affection was confusing, turned
away self-consciously. But Marley whirled his
chair around toward Powell.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am in love,” he said. “I’ve wanted to tell
you, but I—you know who she is.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia Blair?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes. And that’s what’s troubling me,” Marley
went on. “I want to get married, and I can’t. I
can’t,” he repeated, “the law’s too slow; I’ve realized
it for a long while, but I tried to keep the
fact away, I tried not to see it. But now I have
to face it. Why,” he said, rising to his feet, “it’ll
take a thousand years to get a practice in this town,
and I’m not even admitted yet.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He walked to and fro, his brows pinched together,
his lower lip thrust out, his teeth nipping
his upper one. Powell glanced at him, but said
nothing. He knew human nature, this lawyer, and
the fact made every one in the county tremble at
the thought of his cross-examinations; sometimes he
carried too far his love of laying souls bare, and
as often hurt as helped his cause. He never had
been able to turn his knowledge to much practical
account; in a city he would have had numerous
retainers as a trial lawyer, though few as a counselor.
In Macochee he was out of place, and he
chafed under a semi-consciousness of the fact. He
waited, knowing that Marley would burst forth
again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll have to get a job,” Marley said at that
moment, bitterly, “and go to work; that’s all.” And
then he laughed harshly. “Humph, get a job—that’s
the biggest job of all. What can I get here
in Macochee, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p class='c003'>He halted and turned suddenly, fiercely, almost
menacingly on Powell, as if he were the cause of
his predicament.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve told you already it’s no place for you,” said
Powell, quietly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But where’ll I go?” Marley held out his hands
with a gesture that was pleading, pathetic. Thus
he waited for Powell’s reply.</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell smoked thoughtfully for a moment and
then began:</p>

<p class='c003'>“When I was going to the law school in Cincinnati,
there was a young fellow in my class—a
great friend of mine. He was poor, and I was poor—God!
how poor we were!” Powell paused in this
retrospect of poverty. “That was why we were
such friends,—our poverty gave us a common interest.
This fellow came from up in Hardin
County; he was tall, lean and gawky, the worst
jay you ever saw. When we had graduated, I
supposed he would go home, maybe to Kenton—that
was his county-seat. When we were bidding
each other good-by—I’ll never forget the day, it
was June, hot as hell; and we had left the old law
school in Walnut Street and were standing there
by the Tyler-Davidson fountain in Fifth Street.
I said, ‘Well, we’ll see each other once in a while;
we won’t be far apart.’ He looked at me and said,
‘I don’t know about that.’ ‘Why?’ I asked. ‘Well,’
he said, ‘I’m going to Chicago.’ I looked at him
in surprise. He was out at the elbows then, and
had hardly enough money to get home on. Then
the ridiculousness of it struck me, and I laughed.
‘Why, you’ll starve to death there!’ I said. He
only smiled.” Powell paused, to whet Marley’s
appetite, perhaps, for the foregone dénouement.</p>

<p class='c003'>“That jay,” Powell said, when he had allowed
sufficient time to elapse, “that jay I laughed at is
Judge Johnson, of the United States Circuit
Court.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The story saddened Marley. With his faculty of
conceiving a whole drama at once, he caught in an
instant the trials Judge Johnson had gone through
before he won to his station of ease and honor; he
saw the privations, the sacrifices, the hardships,
the endless strivings, plottings, schemings; it wearied
and depressed him; his frightened mind hung
back, clung to the real, the present, the known,
found a relief in picturing the seeming security of
a man like Wade Powell, in a town where he knew
everybody and was known by everybody. He
shrank from hearing more of the judge; he wished
to stay with his thought in Macochee.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How <em>do</em> young men get a start in places like
Macochee?” he asked, and then he added in
despairing argument: “They <em>do</em> stay, they <em>do</em> get
along somehow, they make livings, and raise families;
the town grows and does business, the population
increases, it doesn’t die off.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” said Wade Powell, approaching the
problem with the generalities its mystery demanded,
“some of them marry rich women, but
that industry is about played out now; the fortunes
are divided up; some of them, most of them,
are content to eke out small livings, clerking in
stores and that kind of thing; about the only ones
that get ahead any are traders; they barter around,
first in one business, then in another; they run a
grocery, then sell it out and buy a livery-stable;
then they dabble in real estate a while; finally they
skin some one out of a farm and then they go on
skinning, a little at a time; by the time they’re
old, people forget their beginnings and they become
respectable; then they join the church, like
Selah Dudley.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell stopped a moment, then he began again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The lawyers get along God knows how; the
doctors, well, they never starve, for people will
get sick, or think they’re sick, which is better yet;
then there are a few preachers who are supported in
a poor way by their congregations. When a man
fails, he goes into the insurance business.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell smoked contemplatively for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Sometimes,” he resumed presently, “I feel as
if I were tottering on the verge of the insurance
business myself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked at Powell, who had relapsed into
silence, his head lowered, his eyes fixed in the distance,
and there was something pathetic in the figure,
or would have been, but for the humor that
saved every situation for Powell. There was, however,
something appealing, and something to inspire
affection, too. Marley’s gaze recalled Powell, and
he glanced up with a smile.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I reckon you’ve gathered from my remarks,”
said Powell, “that I consider success chiefly from
a monetary standpoint, but I don’t. The main
business of life is living, and the trouble with the
world is that it is too busy getting ready to live
to find the time for life; it has tied itself up with
a thousand chains of its own forging and it has had
to postpone living from time to time until most
people have put the beginning of life at the gateway
of death; meanwhile they’re busy gathering
things, like magpies, and those that gather the
most are considered the best; they have come to
think that people are divided into two classes, good
and bad; the good are those who own, the bad those
who don’t, and the good think their business is to
put down the bad. Now, here in Gordon County,
we have about everything a man needs; the spring
comes and the summer, and the autumn and the
winter; the rain falls and the winds blow and the
sun shines, and I’ve noticed that Lighttown gets
about as much rain as Main Street, and Gooseville
about as much wind as Scioto Street; the sun seems
to shine pretty much alike on the niggers loafing
in Market Space and on old Selah Dudley and
Judge Blair, bowing like Christians to each other
in the Square. The trees are the same color wherever
they grow, and I don’t see any reason why
people shouldn’t be happy if they’d only let one
another be happy. Now, I would have lived, but I
didn’t have time. I thought when I began that
I’d have to do as the rest were doing, get hold of
things, and I saw that if I did, I’d have to get
my share away from them; well, I made a failure
of that, being too soft inside someway; that was
all right too, but meanwhile I was wasting time,
and putting off living—now it’s too late.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked at him in perplexity, not knowing
how to take him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know,” he said presently. “But what am I
going to do? I can live all right, but I have to do
better than that; I want to get married.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Married,” mused Powell, “married! Well, I
got married.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was interested. He had never heard
Powell speak of his wife, and he feared what he
was about to say; for that instant Powell’s standing
in his estimation trembled.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And that was the only sensible thing I ever
did.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley felt a great relief.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I don’t know that I did right by Mary; I
didn’t do her any good, I reckon; still, she’s borne
up somehow; I wish I had a sky full of sunlight to
pour over her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell walked to his window, and looked across
into the Court-House yard where the leaves were
falling slowly from the Maple-trees. Marley hoped
that he would go on, and say more of his wife, but
he was silent. Presently he turned about.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, Glenn,” he said; “I see you’re stuck on
staying in Macochee, and I don’t blame you; and
you want to get married, and that’s all right. Maybe
I can help you do it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How?” said Marley, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve got a scheme.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, maybe it’ll work, maybe it won’t. I’d
better wait till I see whether it will or not before I
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He stood and smiled at Marley a moment, and
then said: “You wait here.”</p>

<p class='c003'>And he turned and left the office. Marley
watched Powell’s fine figure as he walked across
the street toward the Court House, a great love of
the man surging within him. He felt secure and
safe; a new warmth spread through him. At the
door of the Court House Marley saw him stop
and shake hands with Garver, the sheriff. The two
talked a moment, then turned and went down
toward the big iron gate in Main Street, and
disappeared. Marley waited until noon and then he
went home to his dinner. He returned, but Powell
did not come back to the office all the afternoon.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />THE COUNTY FAIR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley did not see Wade Powell again for
four days; a Sunday intervened, and Powell
did not come back to the office until Monday
morning. He came in with a solemn air upon
him, and a new dignity that made impressive
the seriousness with which he set to work at
the pile of papers on his desk, as if he were beginning
a new week with new resolutions. He
was freshly shaved, and his hair had been cut; it
was shorter at the sides and, against his rough sunburnt
neck, showed an edge of clean white skin.
His newly cropped hair gave him a strange, brisk
appearance; his black clothes were brushed, his
linen fresh.</p>

<p class='c003'>He spoke to Marley but a few times and then
from the distant altitude of his new dignity. Once
he sent Marley on an errand to Snider’s drug store
to buy a large blank book; he said he was going to
keep an office docket after that. He worked on his
new docket half the morning, then he carried the
docket and the bundle of papers over to Marley’s
table, flung them down and asked Marley if he
would not continue the work for him. He explained
the system he had devised for keeping a
record of his cases; it was intricate and complete,
but in many of his cases the numbers and in some
instances the names of opposing parties were missing;
Powell told Marley to go over to the Court
House and get the missing data from the clerk.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve got to go out for a while,” Powell explained.
Then he hurried away; he seemed to be
glad to escape from the office and the drudgery of
the task he had set for himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell’s absence weighed on Marley; he was
lonesome in the deserted office, and found himself
wondering just where Powell was at each moment;
he pictured him with his companions, Colonel
Devlin, Marshall Scarff, Sheriff Garver, old
man Brockton and Doc Hall; lately it had been
rumored that George Halliday had been admitted
to the merry group, and that they played poker
nightly in a room in the Coleman Block. Then
Marley would picture to himself Wade Powell’s
wife; he had never seen her, but he had an idea
of her appearance, formed from no description
of her, but created out of his own fancy. He pictured
her as a graceful little woman, with a certain
droop to her figure; but try as he would,
he could not see her face; it was a blur to him, yet
it gave somehow a certain expression of sweetness
and patience; sometimes, by an effort, he could see
her brow, and the hair above it; the hair was dark,
and parted in the middle with some gray in its
rather heavy mass.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley could never discuss Wade Powell with
any kind of satisfaction with Lavinia. When he
spoke of him, she would smile and affect an interest,
but he could detect the affectation, and he
could detect, also, a certain distance in her attitude
toward Wade Powell or the thought of him,
which he ascribed to the influence of Judge Blair’s
dislike. Marley saw that Lavinia never would accept
Wade Powell, and he had ceased to mention
him except in a casual manner. For some like
reason he had ceased to mention Wade Powell at
home; he found that he had many views which he
could not share with those nearest him, and his
inner life at that time was somewhat lonely and
aloof.</p>

<p class='c003'>He had not told Lavinia of Wade Powell’s offer
of assistance, nor had he spoken of it at home.
In those four days he had thought much of it and
built countless hopes upon it; he had thought of
all the possibilities, and taken a fine delight in examining
each one, working it out to its logical end
in its effect upon Lavinia and him and upon their
fortunes. He was disappointed when Wade Powell
failed to refer to the subject again; he would have
liked to discuss the disappointment with Lavinia;
usually, out of her youthful optimism and faith in
the life of which she was so innocent, she could reassure
him; but of late he had had so many disappointments
and had drawn so heavily on Lavinia’s
resources of comfort and hope that he had
grown wary, almost superstitiously wary, of making
any further drafts.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Monday came and Powell did not renew
the subject, nor even say what his scheme had been,
Marley concluded that Powell had forgotten all
about it, and so he relinquished the hope with a
sigh, and tried to forget it himself. He took up
his studies once more; but he made poor headway;
he saw with chagrin that he had not read ten
pages of law in as many days, and what he had
read he could not remember. When he tried to
review it, the words had no meaning for him, nor
could he wrest any from them, even though he
ground his elbows in the table with the book between
them and dug his fists into his hair.</p>

<p class='c003'>That was the week of the Gordon County fair.
For a month every fence along the white pikes in
the country had borne the bills, flaming from afar
in red ink the date, “Oct. 15-31.” There were,
too, lithographs everywhere—on boards at the
monument, at the Court House, on the town hall,
on the covered bridge over Mad River—lithographs
picturing the exciting finish of a trotting
race, and a sedate concourse of fat cattle. The
fair opened Monday, but it was understood that
that day would be devoted to preparing and arranging
the exhibits; the fair would not begin in earnest
until Tuesday; the big day would be Thursday.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was glad that fair week had come, for
the chance of novelty which it offered, and, too, for
the excuse it gave him; he would not study that
week, but in the general festivity try to forget
the problem that so oppressed him. He would have
liked to go to the fair every day, but he could not,
for the expense, insignificant as it seemed to be to
every one else in the county, was not insignificant
to him. He went, however, on Wednesday with
his father, who, with the love of horses he had inherited
from the saddle-bag days of Methodism,
recklessly attended the races. Marley thought that
this visit would be his last, but on Thursday morning
he met Lawrence in the Square.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just the man I’m looking for!” said Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was brisk, alert, important, and had an official
air which was explained when Marley observed,
on the lapel of his coat, the badge of blue
ribbon that proclaimed an officer of the fair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have charge of the tickets this year,” he said.
“Want to go? I’ll pass you in.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was glad enough to accept.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ll have to go around to the office and tell
Powell,” he said. “I was away all day yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, nonsense,” replied Lawrence, “that won’t
make any difference; he’s been full for two days.
This is his big time.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley had a pang as he saw with what small
seriousness Lawrence regarded his relation to the
law; it reflected, doubtless, the common attitude
of the community toward him and his efforts.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve got to hurry,” Lawrence went on; “I’ve
got a rig waiting here; you can ride out with me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>It was one of the incomparable afternoons that
autumn brings to Ohio; the retreating sun was
flashing in the high, blue sky; the air was fresh and
Marley felt it full of energy and hope. Lawrence
drove rapidly through the throng of hurrying vehicles
that crowded the road to the fair-grounds,
stirring up a cloud of dust that covered everything
with its white powder.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence left him at the gate, being too full of
business to engage in the weary search for pleasure,
and Marley set out alone across the scorched
and trampled turf for the grand stand, black with
people for the races. He could hear the nervous
clamor of the bell in the judges’ stand, the notes
of the hand-organ at the squeaking merry-go-round,
the incessant thumping of the bass drum that made
its barbaric music for the side-show, and the cries
of venders, dominating all the voices of the thousands
bent in their silly way on pleasure. Once,
calling him back to the real, to the peace of the
commonplace, he heard the distant tones of the
town clock in the tower that stood, a mile away,
above the autumnal trees.</p>

<p class='c003'>He pressed into the space between the grand
stand and the whitewashed fence that surrounded
the track; through the palings he could see the
stoop-shouldered drivers, bent over the heavily
breathing trotters they jogged to and fro; above
him, in the grand stand, he could distinguish cries
and laughs, now and then complete excited sentences,
sometimes voices he knew. All around
him the farmers, clumsy in their ready-made
clothes and bearing their buggy whips as some
insignia of office, solemnly watched the races and
talked of horses.</p>

<p class='c003'>The sense of kinship with the crowd that had unerringly
drawn Marley left him the moment he
was in the crowd, and a loneliness replaced the
sense of kinship. He looked about for some one
he knew. He began, here and there, to recognize
faces, just as he had recognized voices in the din
above him; he began to analyze and to classify the
crowd, and he laughed somewhat cynically when he
saw numbers of politicians going about among the
farmers, shaking their hands, greeting them effusively,
calling them by their Christian names.
Then suddenly he saw Wade Powell. The crowd
at the point where Powell stood, nucleated with
him as its center; by the way the men were laughing,
and by the way Powell was trying not to
laugh, Marley knew that he had been telling them
one of his stories, and from the self-conscious,
guilty expressions on certain of the faces, Marley
knew that the story was probably one that should
not have been told. Several countrymen hung on
the edge of the group, not identifying themselves
with it, yet anxious to have a look at Wade Powell,
who enjoyed the fame of the county’s best criminal
lawyer.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Powell saw Marley he called to him, and
when Marley drew near, he introduced him, somehow
mysteriously, almost surreptitiously, to the
man at his elbow. Powell’s face was very red, and
his eyes were brilliant. The mystery he put into
his introduction was but a part of his manner.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This is Mr. Carman, of Pleasant Grove Township,
Glenn,” he said, bending over, as if no one
should hear the name; and then he added, in a
husky whisper: “He’s our candidate for county
clerk, you know.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley saw something strange, forbidding, in
Carman’s face, but he could not tell what it was.
It was a red, sunburnt face, closely shaven, with
a short mustache burned by the sun; the smile it
wore seemed to be fixed and impersonal. Plainly
the man had spent his days out of doors, though, it
seemed, not healthfully, for his skin was dry and
hardened, and his neck thin and wrinkled; he
seemed to have known the hard work and the poor
nourishment of a farm. Marley wondered what
was the matter with Carman’s face. But Powell
was drawing them aside.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Come over here,” he was saying, “where we
can be alone.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He led them to a corner of the little yard; no one
was near; they were quite out of the crowd which
was pressing to the whitewashed picket fence,
attracted by the excitement of the race for which
the horses were just then scoring.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now, Jake,” Powell began, speaking to Carman,
“this is the young man I was talking to you
about.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman, still smiling his dry meaningless smile,
turned his face half away.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I reckon,” Powell went on, “that I might be
able to do you some good, if I took off my coat.”
Powell spoke with a pride in his own influence;
Marley had never known him to come so near
to boasting before.</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman was looking away; and Powell, his own
eyes narrowed, was watching him closely. Once
he winked at Marley, and Marley was mystified;
he did not know what play was going on here; he
looked from Carman to Powell, and back to Carman
again. There was some strange fascination
about Carman; Marley felt a slight relief when he
discovered that there was something peculiar
about Carman’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I haven’t said anything to Marley about the
matter, Jake,” Powell said. “Maybe I’d better
tell him. Hell! He might not want it—I don’t
know.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman turned suddenly; his face had been in
the shadow; now it came into the sunlight, and
Marley saw that while the pupil of Carman’s right
eye contracted suddenly, the pupil of his left eye
remained fixed; it was larger than the pupil of
the right eye, which had shrunk to a pin-point in
the sharp light of the sun. Marley looked closely,
the left eye seemed to be swimming in liquid; it
almost hurt Marley’s eyes to look at it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve been telling Carman, Glenn,” Powell was
explaining, “that if he is elected—and gets into
the Court House—”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked at Powell expectantly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I want him,” Powell went on, “to make you
his deputy.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley saw it all in a flash; this was what
Powell had meant that day a fortnight ago; he
felt his great affection for Powell glow and
warm; Lavinia would appreciate Powell after
this. It meant salary, position, a place in which
he might complete his law studies at his leisure;
it meant a living, a home, marriage, Lavinia!
He looked all his gratitude at Powell, who smiled
appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman had turned his face away again, he
was still smiling, and plucking now at his chin;
Marley waited, and Powell finally grew impatient.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, Jake, what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman waited a moment longer, then slowly
turned about. Marley watched him narrowly, he
saw the pupil of his right eye contract, the pupil
of the watery left eye remained fixed; then, for
the first time, Carman looked steadily at Marley
and for the first time he spoke.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” he said, and he stopped to spit out his
tobacco, “you know I’m always ready to do a friend
a good turn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell looked Carman over carefully a moment,
and then he said,</p>

<p class='c003'>“All right, Jake.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Just then there was a rush of hoofs, a shock of
excitement, and they heard a loud yell:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Go!”</p>

<p class='c003'>And they rushed to the fence of the whitewashed
palings.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />THE ROAD TO MINGO</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Lavinia sat rocking quietly back and forth,
and stitched away with her colored silks on
her tambourine frames, while Marley told her
of the fortune Wade Powell had brought them.
He told the story briefly, and he tried to tell it
simply; he did not comment on Powell’s kindness
or generosity, but let his deeds speak for themselves
in Powell’s behalf. When he had done, Marley
waited for Lavinia’s comment, but she rocked on
a moment and then held her tambourine frames at
arm’s length to study the sweet pea she was making.
When she had done so, she dropped her sewing
suddenly into her lap, and looking up, said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“He thinks everything of you, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I believe he likes me,” Marley said, as modestly
as he could put it.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Who could help it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia looked at Marley, and he leaned over,
and took her hands.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I am glad you can’t, sweetheart,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you know,” she went on, “I think it is because
you have been kind and good to him—just
as you are kind and good to every one. His life
is lonely; he is an outcast, almost; no one cares
for him, and he appreciates your goodness.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Pity was the utmost feeling she could produce
for Wade Powell out of her kindly heart. But
Marley, though he could accept her homage to the
full without embarrassment, could not acquiesce
to this length, and he laughed at her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nonsense, Lavinia,” he said. “You have the
thing all topsy-turvy. It is Wade Powell who has
been kind to me; it is he and not I who is good
to every one. He has a heart brimful of the milk
of human kindness. You have no idea, and no
one has, of the good he does in a thousand little
ways. He tries to hide it all; he acts as if he
were ashamed of it, but there are hundreds of
people in Macochee who worship him, and would
be ready to die for him, if it would help him any.
Don’t think he has no friends! He has them by
the score—of course, they are all poor; I reckon
that’s why they are generally unknown.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But isn’t he cruel?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley’s eyes widened in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I mean,” Lavinia said correctively, “isn’t he
kind of sarcastic?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” Marley admitted, “he is that at times.
I think he tries to hide his better qualities; I
think he tries to cloak his finer nature with a
rough garb. Perhaps it is because he is really so
sensitive. But he is, to my mind, a truly great
man. He is a sort of tribune of the people.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But, Glenn, what about his drinking?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, that’s the trouble,” Marley said, shaking
his head. “If he had let liquor alone he’d have
been away up.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia was silent a moment, her brow was knit
in little wrinkles.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Glenn,” she said presently, “I have been thinking.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That with your influence you might reform him—out
of his liking for you, don’t you know?”</p>

<p class='c003'>She raised her blue eyes. He laughed outright,
and then took her face between his two hands.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You dear little thing!” he said, with the patronage
of a lover.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia regained her dignity.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But couldn’t you?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, dear heart,” Marley said, “he would
think it presumption. I wouldn’t dare.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia shook her head in the hopelessness of
the reformer, and took up her tambourine frames
again with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s a pity,” she said, relinquishing the subject
with the hope, “it’s such a pity.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But you haven’t told me what you think
of the scheme.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You know, dear, that whatever you think best
I think best.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was disappointed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You don’t seem to be very enthusiastic over
the prospect,” he complained. “I thought you’d
be glad as I to know that I can at last make a
place for myself in the world—and a home and a
living for you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia looked up.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I never had any doubt of that, Glenn,” she
said simply.</p>

<p class='c003'>He saw the trust and confidence she had in him,
a trust and a confidence he had never felt himself,
and had never before been wholly aware of
in her. He saw that she had never shared those
fears which had so long oppressed him, and into
his love there came a devout thankfulness. He
felt strong, hopeful, confident, victorious. He had
a sudden fancy that it would be like this when
they were married; he would sit at his own hearth,
with a fire crackling merrily, and the rain and
wind beating outside—for the first time he could
indulge such a fancy; it allowed him, now that his
future was assured, to come up to it and to take
hold of it; it became a reality.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge was not at home that night. Now
and then Marley could hear Mrs. Blair speak a
word to Connie and Chad, over their lessons in
the sitting-room; school had commenced, and Connie
having that year entered the High School had
taken on a new dignity, in consequence of which
she was treating Chad with a divine patience
that brought its own peace into the Blair household.</p>

<p class='c003'>They talked for a long time of their plans.
Marley would take his new place in December
when the new county clerk went into office, and
he told Lavinia all the advantages of the position.
It would extend his acquaintance, it would give
him a familiarity with court proceedings that otherwise
he could not have acquired in years. He
meant to study hard, and be admitted to the bar.
They could have a little cottage and live simply
and economically; he would save part of his salary,
and when he hung out his shingle he would have
enough money laid by to support them, modestly,
until he could establish himself in a practice.
He laid it all before her plainly, convincingly.
He was charmed with the practicability of the
plan, with its conservatism, its common sense.
They might as well be married.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Can’t we?” he asked. He trembled as he
asked; his happiness had never come so close before.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia dropped her embroidery frames into her
lap and looked up at him. The question in her
eyes was almost born of fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Right away?” exclaimed Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, almost right away,” Marley answered.
“Sometime this winter, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“This winter! So soon?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“So soon!” Marley repeated her words, almost
in mockery.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But we mustn’t be married in the winter,”
she said, “we’ve always planned to be married in
June—our month, you know.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’s the use of waiting?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But papa and mama—”</p>

<p class='c003'>This quick rushing to the parental cover, this
clinging to the habit of years struck a jealousy
through Marley’s heart. His face fell and he
looked hurt.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Can’t we, dear?” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia looked at him, and she said shyly:</p>

<p class='c003'>“If you say so, Glenn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They were solemn in their joy and made their
plans in detail. They would be married quietly,
Lavinia said, and at home. Doctor Marley would
perform the ceremony, and Marley was touched
by this recognition of his father.</p>

<p class='c003'>The fall worked a new energy in Marley, and,
with the assurance that his labors were now soon
to bear fruit, he found that he could study better
than ever before. He worked faithfully over his
books every morning, and he worked so hard that
he felt himself entitled to a portion of each afternoon.
He would leave the office at four o’clock.
Lavinia would be waiting for him, and they would
try to get out of sight before Connie returned from
school. She might be expected any moment to
come slowly down Ward Street entwined with
one of her school-girl friends. They did not like,
somehow, to meet Connie. The smile she gave
them was apt to be disconcerting. They met
smiles in the faces of others they encountered in
their walks, but they were of a quality more kindly
than Connie’s smile.</p>

<p class='c003'>They had walked one afternoon to the edge of
town where Ward Street climbed a hill and became
the road to Mingo. At their feet lay the
little fields, in the distance they could see a man
plowing with two white horses; off to the right
lay the water-works pond, gleaming in the afternoon
sun.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What are you thinking of?” Marley said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I was thinking that it would be nice to live in
the country.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I was thinking that very thing myself!” exclaimed
Marley. Their eyes met, and they thrilled
over this unity in their thoughts. It was marvelous
to them, mysterious, prophetic.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Some day I could buy a farm,” Marley said;
“out that way.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” Lavinia replied, “away off there, beyond
those low trees. Do you see?”</p>

<p class='c003'>She pointed, but Marley did not look in the direction
of the trees; he looked at her finger. It
was so small, so round, so white. He bent forward,
and kissed the finger.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, but you must look where I’m pointing,”
said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>They drew closely together. Marley took Lavinia’s
hand and they stood long in silence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“We could have a country home there,” Marley
said after a while, “with a hedge about it and
stables and horses and dogs. It would be close to
town; I could go in in the morning and out again
in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And I could drive you in, and then come for
you in the afternoon—when court adjourned.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I would have a man to drive me,” said
Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But couldn’t I ride in beside you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes; you could sit beside me, on the back
seat; we’d have an open carriage.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“A victoria!” exclaimed Lavinia. “It would
be the only one in Macochee!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is that what they call them?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Victorias?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You know, with a low seat behind and a high
seat for the driver. You have a green cushion
for your feet. You would look so handsome in
one, Glenn. You would sit very erect and proud,
with your hands on a cane. You would have white
hair then.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We would be old?” he asked in some dismay.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, no,” said Lavinia, trying to reconcile her
dreams, “not old exactly. But I dote on white
hair. It’s so distinguished for a lawyer with a
country home. Of course we’ll have to get old
sometime.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We’ll grow old together, dear.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” she whispered, “and think of the long
years of happiness!”</p>

<p class='c003'>They stood and gazed, looking down the long
vista of years that stretched before them as smooth
and peaceful as the white road to Mingo.</p>

<p class='c003'>A subtile change was passing over the face of
the road; shadows were stealing toward it, and
it was growing gray. The trees that still were
green were darkening to a deeper green, but the
colors of those that had changed flamed all the
brighter. The sun shone more golden on the shocks
of corn, the sky was glowing pink in the west, the
water-works pond was glistening as the sun’s shafts
struck it more obliquely. A fine powder hung in
the peaceful air.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How beautiful the fall is!” said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, I love it,” said Marley. “But do you
know, dear, that I never liked it before? It always
seemed sad to me. But you have taught me to
love many things. You don’t know all that you
have done for me!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She stood in her blue dress, with her hands
folded before her. Marley looked at her hands,
and at her white throat, and at her hair, its brown
turned to a golden hue by the clear light; then
he looked into her eyes. A sudden emotion, almost
religious in its ecstasy, came over him. He bent
forward.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh!” he exclaimed. “Do you know how beautiful
you are! I worship you!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t, Glenn,” she said, “don’t say that!” The
reflection of a superstitious fear lay in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why?” he said defiantly. “It’s all true. You
are my religion.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You frighten me,” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley laughed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why!” he exclaimed, “there’s nothing to fear.
Isn’t our future assured now?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />WAKING</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Carman was inducted into office the first
Monday in December, quietly, as the <em>Republican</em>
said, as though it reflected credit on
the new county clerk as a man who modestly
avoided the demonstration that might have been
expected under such circumstances. Marley, in
the hope of seeing his own name, eagerly ran his
eyes down the few lines that were devoted to the
occurrence, but his name was not there, the <em>Republican’s</em>
reporter, as he felt, being a man who lacked
a sense of the relative importance of events.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley had taken no part in the campaign,
though Wade Powell wished him to, and suggested
every now and then that he speak at some of the
meetings that were being held in the country schoolhouses.
Powell said it would be good practice for
him in a profession where so much talking has to
be done, and he found other reasons why Marley
should do this, as that it would extend his acquaintance,
and give him a standing with the party; but,
though Marley was always promising, he was
always postponing; the thought of standing up and
speaking to the vast audiences his imagination was
able to crowd into a little school-room filled him
with fear, and he never could bring himself to consent
to any definite time. Besides this, he could
not find an evening he was willing to spend away
from Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>When election was over, he expected that he
would hear from Carman, but he had no word
from him. Several times he was on the point of
mentioning the subject to Wade Powell, but somehow,
with a reticence for which he reproached
himself, he could not bring himself to do it. He
watched the papers closely, but he found it quite
as hard to find in them any information about Carman
as on any other subject, except, possibly, the
banal personalities of the town as they related
themselves to the coming and going of the trains.</p>

<p class='c003'>But at last, on the day it had occurred to the
reporter to chronicle the fact that Carman had been
inducted into office, the little item struck Marley
sadly; he felt a sense of detachment from Carman;
he could not altogether realize that intimate relationship
to Carman in his new official position that
he felt belonged to one who was to be Carman’s
deputy. In his imagination he saw Carman shambling
about in the dingy room where the county
clerk kept the records of the court, his knees unhinging
loosely at each step, his shoulders bent, his
hands in his trousers pockets, his right eye squinting
here and there observantly, the left fixed, impervious
to light and shadow, to all that was going
on in the world. He wondered if Carman, as he
looked about, had been thinking in any wise of
him or had seen him as a part of the place where
his life was to be lived for the next three years.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley read the paper at supper time; in the
evening he went to see Lavinia. She too had read
the paper.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know,” she said simply, and he was grateful
for her quick intuition. “Have you seen him?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Are you going to?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Would you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, certainly, at once.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley went to the Court House the first thing
in the morning. He feared he might have arrived
too early, but Carman had the virtue that goes
farther perhaps than any other in the affections
and approval of men, he rose early. He had been
at his office since long before seven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley found the new county clerk at his desk,
obviously ready for business. The desk was clean,
with a cleanness that was rather a barrenness than
an order. The ink-wells, the pens, with their shining
new steel points, the fresh blotters, all were
laid on the clean pad with geometrical exactness.
The pigeon holes were empty, but they were all
lettered as if the mind of the new county clerk
had grappled with the future, come off victorious,
and provided for every possible emergency, though
there were certain contingencies that had impressed
him as “Miscellaneous.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman looked up with the obliging expression
of the new public official, but Marley’s heart instantly
sank with a foreboding that told him he
might as well turn about then and go. It was
plain that Carman saw nothing in the call beyond
a mere incident of the day’s work.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley took a chair near Carman’s desk. He
looked at Carman once, and then looked instantly
away; the eye that lacked the power of accommodation
was fixed on him, and it made him nervous.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you remember me, Mr. Carman?” asked
Marley; and then fearing the reply he hastened to
add: “I’m Glenn Marley; Mr. Powell introduced
me to you out at the fair-grounds last fall.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, I remember,” said Carman.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I suppose you know what I came for?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman’s right eye widened somewhat in an expression
of mild surprise.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You know,” urged Marley, “the clerkship.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What clerkship was that?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, don’t you know? The chief clerkship, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, yes. Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman’s right eye wore a puzzled look.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, you’ve got me,” said Carman, with a
little laugh of apology.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, I understood,” Marley went on, “that
in the event of your election I was to have a position
here.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What as?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why—as chief deputy.”</p>

<p class='c003'>That right eye of Carman’s was fixed on him
questioningly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Chief deputy?” he said finally. “Here—in
my office?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, yes,” said Marley. “Don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The question in the right eye had given way to a
surprise that was growing in Carman’s mind, and
spreading contagiously to a surprise, deeper and
more acute, in Marley’s mind. The eye had
something reproachful in its steady stare. Marley
leaned over impulsively.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, surely you haven’t forgotten—that day
out at the fair-grounds, when Mr. Powell introduced
me to you? I understood, I always understood
that I was to have the place. I never mentioned
it to you afterward, I didn’t like to bother
you, you know. I waited along, feeling that everything
was all right. But when election was over—and
afterward, when you took your office, and I
didn’t hear anything—I thought I’d come around
and see you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Despite the sinister left eye, Marley leaned
close to Carman and waited. Carman was long in
bringing himself to speak. Even then he did not
seem to be sure of the situation he was dealing
with.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You say you understood you was to have a job
under me as chief clerk?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, yes,” replied Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Who’d you understand it from, me or Wade
Powell?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well—” Marley hesitated, “I thought I understood
it from you; I certainly understood it
from Mr. Powell.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You say you got the idea from something I
said out at the fair-grounds?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, sir, at the fair-grounds.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Carman turned away and knitted his brows.</p>

<p class='c003'>“At the fair-grounds,” he said presently, as
though talking more to himself than to Marley.
“The fair-grounds, h-m. Yes, I do remember—”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley’s heart stirred with a little hope.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I do remember seeing you there, and talking
to you. But I don’t remember making you any
promises. Did you ask me?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No; Mr. Powell did that.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And what did I say?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” Marley answered, “I can’t recall your
exact words, but I got the impression, and so did
Mr. Powell, I’m sure, that it was all right, I—I
counted on it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, say, Glenn,” he said; “I’m awfully sorry,
honest I am. I remember now, come to think of
it, that Wade did say something like that, and
maybe I said something to lead you to think I’d do
it; I don’t say I didn’t—I don’t just remember.
But I reckon you’ve banked more on what Wade
told you than on what I did. Course, I reckon
I didn’t turn you down—a feller never does that
in a campaign, you know. But Wade takes a lot
o’ things for granted in this life.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He smiled indulgently, as if Powell’s weaknesses
were commonly known and understood.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I reckon you relied too much on what Wade
told you,” Carman went on. His right eye was fixed
on Marley, but Marley did not return the look.
He had turned half-way round and thrown his
arm over the back of his chair. He looked out
the window, his eyes vacant and sad. He was
thinking of Lavinia, of their hopes and plans, of
the little home that had become almost a reality to
them; the trees in the Court-House yard held
their gaunt limbs helplessly up against the cold
December day; the ugly clouds were hurrying
desperately across the sky; he thought of the little
law office across the street, with the dusty law books
lying on the table, and the hopelessness of it
all overwhelmed him. But there beside him Carman
still was speaking:</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s like Wade,” he was saying. “I’m sorry,
derned if I hain’t.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley scarcely heard him. He was looking
ahead. How many years—</p>

<p class='c003'>“He hadn’t ought to of done it,” Carman was
going on; “no, sir, he hadn’t ought.”</p>

<p class='c003'>How many years, Marley was thinking, would
they have to wait now? Would Lavinia be lost
with all the rest? Ought he to ask her to wait any
longer? But Carman kept on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve got all my arrangements made now, you
see.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He swept his arm about the office where the few
clerks were bending over the big records in which
they were copying the pleadings they could not
understand. Marley did not see; he saw nothing
but the ruin of all his hopes. It was still in there;
the atmosphere held the musty odor of a public office;
the clock ticked; once a stamping machine
clicked sharply as a clerk marked a filing date on
some document. And then a great disgust overwhelmed
him, a disgust with himself for being so
fatuous, so credulous. He had taken so much for
granted, he had acted as a child, not as a man,
and he felt a hatred for himself, he felt almost
like striking himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I guess I’ve been a fool,” he said suddenly,
rising from his chair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, you haven’t neither,” said Carman, “but
Wade Powell has; he had no business—”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley did not wait to hear Carman finish his
sentence. Shame and mortification were the final
aspects of his defeat; he put on his hat, drew it
down over his eyes and stalked away. Carman
looked at him as he disappeared through the lofty
door. The pupil of his right eye widened as he
looked, and when Glenn had passed from his
sight he turned to his desk, and began to rearrange
the tools to which he was so unaccustomed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />HEART OF GRACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley sighed in relief when he went up
the steps of the Blair house that evening.
Somehow he had got through the long, desolate
day. He was sore from his great defeat, but the
worst, at any rate, was over; the pang had been
sharp, but now the pain had been dulled. He
had spent the day in the office. Wade Powell had
been in and out, but never once had he spoken of
the clerkship, and Marley was too deep in humiliation
to mention it. His one consolation was in
the fact that he had never told any one of his prospect,
not even his own mother; it had been a secret
which he and Lavinia had shared luxuriously;
though, as Marley now looked back on their joy,
he realized that what had kept him from telling
any one was a prudent skepticism, a lack of faith
in the possibility of human happiness, an inherited
dread of the calamity that stalks every joy.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia flung the hall door wide for him before
he could ring the bell.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How did you know anything was?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why,” she exclaimed, “I could tell the minute
I heard your step. Tell me—what is it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley, ever sensitive to atmospheres, instantly
felt the peace of the household. The glow from the
living-room, a quiet voice speaking a commonplace
word now and then, told him that Mrs. Blair was
there with Connie and Chad, and he knew the children
were at their lessons; he caught the faint
odor of a cigar, and he knew that Judge Blair
was in his library reading peacefully of the dead
and silent past, whose men had left all their troubles
in the leaves of printed books; all round him
life was flowing on, unconsciously, and normally;
the tumult and strife in his own soul were nothing
to the world. All this flashed on him in an instant—and
there was Lavinia, standing before him,
her white brow knit in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tell me,” she was saying, “what it is.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I don’t get the job, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He felt a momentary savage pleasure in the pain
he inflicted, justifying it in the thought that he
eased his own suffering by giving it to another.
Then as quickly he repented, and felt ashamed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is that all?” she said. She had come close to
him, smiling in her sympathy, and then lifting a
hand to his forehead.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t do that,” she said, as if she would erase
the scowl.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they were seated he gave her the details of
his meeting with Carman, and with the recital of
his disappointment its sharpness was repeated. He
leaned over, his elbows on his knees, and clutched
his hair in his fists. For an instant a kind of relief
came to Lavinia, a relief that a crisis in her
life had been postponed, a crisis from which, instinctively,
she had shrunk. Her life could go
on for a while as it had always gone on; change,
which mortals dread, was delayed. Then in
another moment her sympathy went out to him; she
was on the floor at his knees, her arms about him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t, dear, don’t,” she pleaded. “Why, it is
nothing. What does it matter? What does anything
matter, so long as we have each other?”</p>

<p class='c003'>She stroked his hair, she called him by all her
endearing names. She tried to take his hands from
his face, that she might get him to look at her.
But he resisted.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” he said. “I’m no good; I’m a failure;
I’m worse than a failure. I’m a fool, a poor,
weak, silly fool.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Hush, Glenn, hush!” she whispered, as if he
were uttering blasphemies. “You must not, you
must not!”</p>

<p class='c003'>She shook him in a kind of fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look at me!” she said. “Look at me!”</p>

<p class='c003'>He remained obdurate, slowly shaking his head
from side to side.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look at me!” Lavinia repeated. “Don’t you
see—don’t you see that—I love you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>A change came over him, subtile, but distinct.
Slowly he raised his head, and then he put his
arms about her and held her close, and gradually
a comfort stole over him,—a comfort so delicious
that he felt himself hardly worthy, because he now
saw that all through the day he had had a
subconsciousness that it would come to him at evening,
and that he had somehow exaggerated his own grief
in order to make this certain comfort the sweeter
when it came.</p>

<p class='c003'>It seemed to Marley, after he and Lavinia had
sat there for a while, that he had come out of some
nightmare; sanity returned, things assumed once
more their proper proportions and relations to each
other. He found himself smiling, if not laughing
just yet, and with Lavinia’s hope and confidence
the future opened to him once more. Now and
then, of course, his disappointment would roll
over him as a great wave, and once he said ruefully:</p>

<p class='c003'>“But think of the little home we were going to
have!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But we’re going to have it,” Lavinia replied,
smiling on him, “we’re going to have it, just the
same!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But we’ll have to wait!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, we’re young,” said Lavinia, “and it
won’t be so very long.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I wanted it to be in the spring.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“May be it will be, who knows?” Lavinia could
smile in this reassurance, now that she knew it
could not be in the spring.</p>

<p class='c003'>They discussed their future in all its phases,
with the hope that Lavinia could so easily inspire
in him; Marley was to keep on with his law
studies; there was nothing else now to do—unless
something should turn up—there was always that
hope.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And it will, you’ll see,” said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>They discussed, too, Carman and Wade Powell.
Marley thought that Lavinia might return to her
old severity with Powell; when he expected her to
do this, he was preparing to defend Powell; when
she did not, but was generous with him, and urged
Marley to reflect that he had done all he had done
out of a spirit of kindness, Marley was disposed to
be severe with Powell himself. Carman, they
agreed, had acted handsomely; they could not find
cause to blame him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” said Marley, “he treated me all right; I
believe he was really sorry for me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>And then, at the thought of Carman’s having
pity for him, his rebellion flamed up again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s humiliating, that’s what it is. Wade
Powell had no business making a monkey of me in
that way; though it doesn’t take much to make a
monkey of me; I had the job almost completed
myself, just waiting for some one to come along
and put the finishing touches on. And Wade
Powell did that!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley spoke in the sardonic humor the wounded
and beaten spirit likes to employ in dealing with
itself. But Lavinia hushed him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You just can not talk that way about yourself,
Glenn,” she declared with her finest air of ownership.
“I won’t let you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, it’s so humiliating,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, no, it can’t be that,” Lavinia argued.
“You can not feel humiliated. You have done
nothing that need cause you any humiliation. We
are the only ones who can humiliate ourselves;
nothing but our own actions can humiliate us; no
one else can.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia had a smiling little triumph in her own
philosophy, but she quickly compromised it by an
inconsistency.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Besides, no one else knows about it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” Marley agreed thoughtfully, and without
noticing her inconsistency. “No one else knows
anything about it. We have that to be thankful
for, anyway.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />CHRISTMAS EVE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Lawrence was arranging for a grand ball in
the Odd Fellows’ Hall, on Christmas Eve, and
he had, as he came around to the office one
day to assure Marley, counted him and Lavinia
in. Marley, glad enough to close the law-book he
was finding more and more irksome, listened to
Lawrence’s enthusiasm for a while, but said at
last:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m afraid I can’t go.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why not? Lavinia will want to go; she always
does.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know that,” Marley admitted, “but I can’t,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lawrence looked at him intently for a moment.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Say, Glenn, what’s the matter with you?” he
said. “Anything been going wrong lately? You
look like you were in the dumps.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley shook his head with a negative gesture
that admitted all Lawrence had said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You ain’t fretting over that job, are you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What job?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked up suddenly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, with Carman.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How’d you know?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, everybody knows about that,” Lawrence
replied with a light air that added to Marley’s
gloom; “but what of it? I wouldn’t let that cut
me up; come out and show yourself a little more!
You don’t want to keep Lavinia housed up there,
away from all the fun that’s going on, do you?
Mayme and I were talking about it the other
night; you and Lavinia haven’t been to a thing for
months; it isn’t right, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked sharply at Lawrence for a minute,
and Lawrence marking the resentment in his
eyes, hastened on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t get mad, now; I don’t mean anything.
I’m only saying it for your good. I think you
need a little shaking up, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia can do as she likes,” Marley said with
dignity. “I shall not hinder her; I never have.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, don’t get sore now, old man; I didn’t
mean to hurt your feelings. The holidays are here
and you want to cut into the game; it’s a time to
forget your troubles and have a little fun; you’ve
only got one life to live; what’s the use of taking
it so seriously?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley looked at Lawrence with a genuine envy
for an instant, as at a man who never took anything
in life very seriously; he looked at the new
overcoat Lawrence held over his knee, showing its
satin lining; and then, reflecting that Lawrence’s
father had left with his estate a block of bank
stock which had given Lawrence his position in
the bank, Marley’s impatience with him returned
and he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, it’s easy enough for you to talk; if you were
in my place you might find it different.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“That’s all right,” Lawrence went on, a smile on
his freckled face. “You just come to the party;
it’ll cost you only five, and Lavinia would like it.
I know that. So do you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley did know it; and he felt a new disgust
with himself that remained with him long after
Lawrence had put on his new overcoat and left. He
reproached himself bitterly, and he told himself
that the best thing he could do would be to go
away somewhere, and not tell Lavinia, or anybody.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m only in her way, that’s all,” he thought
as he opened his law-book, and bent it back viciously,
so that it would stay open.</p>

<p class='c003'>Ever since the fiasco of his plans as to a place
with Carman, he had been seeking consolation in
a new resolution to keep on patiently in the law;
but it was a consolation that he had to keep active
by a constant contemplation of himself as a young
man who was making a brave and determined fight
against heavy odds. It was difficult to sustain this
heroic attitude in his own eyes and at the same time
maintain that modesty which he knew would become
him best in the eyes of others. The approach
of the holiday season, the visible preparations on
every hand and the gay spirits everywhere apparent
had isolated him more than ever, and he had felt
his alienation complete whenever he went to see
Lavinia and found the whole Blair family in an
excitement over their own festival. Marley would
have liked to make Lavinia handsome gifts, but
his debts were already large, relatively, and he
rose to heights of self-denial that made him pathetic
to himself, when he decided that he could
give her nothing. Now that Lawrence was getting
up a ball to which he knew Lavinia would like to
go, as she had always gone to the balls that were
not so frequent in Macochee as Lawrence wished
they might be, he felt his humiliation deeper
than ever. He put the matter honestly to Lavinia,
however, and she said promptly:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, I wouldn’t think of going.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She looked up at him brightly, and then in an
instant she looked down again. She relished the
nobility of the attitude she had so promptly taken,
but the woman in her prevailed over the saint, and
told what a moment before she had determined not
to tell:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve already declined one invitation.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She saw the look of pain come into Marley’s eyes,
and instantly she regretted.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You have?” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, yes.” She looked at him with her head
turned to one side; her face wore an expression
he did not like to see.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was on Marley’s lips to ask who had invited
her, but his pride would not let him do that; somehow
a sense of separation fell suddenly between
them. He examined with deep interest the arm
of his chair.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” he began presently, “I wouldn’t have
you stay away on my account, you know.” He
looked up suddenly. “Please don’t stay away, Lavinia.
I’d like to have you go.”</p>

<p class='c003'>There was contrition in her voice as she almost
flew to reply:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, you dear old thing, it was only George
Halliday who asked me; and when I told him I
wouldn’t go he was actually relieved; he said he
didn’t want to go himself; he hates our little
functions out here, you know, and has ever since
he came back from Harvard. I suppose he was
used to so much more in Cambridge!” Lavinia had
a sneer in her tone, and it took on a shade of irritation
as she added: “He asked me only because
he was sorry for me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, sorry for you,” Marley repeated bitterly.
“That’s another thing I’ve done for you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Please don’t, dear,” said Lavinia, “don’t let
yourself get bitter. It’ll be all right. We’ll spend
Christmas Eve here at home and have ever so much
more fun by ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair told Marley that she wished Lavinia
might go to the ball; her father wished it, too.
Mrs. Blair told him that she could easily get
George Halliday to take her,—their lifelong intimacy
with the Hallidays permitted that. Marley
assured her that he wished Lavinia to accept Halliday’s
invitation, but that she would not do so.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’d take her myself,” he added, “only I can’t
dance, and—I have no money. I’d like to have
her go, if it would give her pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I know you would, you dear boy,” said Mrs.
Blair, laying her hand on his shoulder in her affectionate
way.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair urged Lavinia to go, and so did Marley,
and when he saw that she was determined not
to go, he urged her all the more strongly, because,
now that he was sure of her position, he could so
much more enjoy his own disinterestedness and
magnanimity. They desisted when Lavinia complained
that they were making her life miserable.</p>

<p class='c003'>Though Marley could deny Lavinia the dance,
he found, after all, that he could not deny himself
the distinction of giving her a Christmas present.
His heroic attitude gradually broke under the temptation
of Hoffman’s jewelry store, glittering with
its holiday display. Marley already owed Hoffman
for Lavinia’s ring, but like most of the merchants
in Macochee, Hoffman had to do business on an
elastic credit, if he wished to do any business at all,
and Marley, after many pains of selection, did not
have much difficulty in inducing Hoffman to let
him have the pearl opera-glasses he finally chose in
the despair of thinking of anything better.</p>

<p class='c003'>The opera-glasses might have atoned for the
deprivation of the ball, had Marley been able to
think of them with any comfort. The delight Lavinia
expressed in a gift she could never use in
Macochee, and the enthusiasm with which Connie
admired them, made him nervous and guilty.
Connie had temporarily foregone her claims to
young-ladyhood, and was a child again for a little
while. Her excitement and that of Chad should
have made any Christmas Eve merry, but it was not
a merry Christmas Eve for Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>As Lavinia and he sat in the parlor they caught
now and then, or imagined they caught, the strains
of the orchestra that was playing for the dancers in
the Odd Fellows’ Hall, and they were both conscious
that life would be tolerable for them only
when the music should cease and the ball take its
place among the things of the past, incapable of
further trouble in the earth.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s very trying,” said Judge Blair to his wife
that night. “I wish there was something we could
do.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“So do I,” his wife acquiesced.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t like to see Lavinia cut off this way from
every enjoyment. The strain must be very wearing.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I suppose it is very wearing with most lovers,”
said Mrs. Blair. “I don’t see how they ever endure
it; but they all do.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Have you talked with her about it?” The judge
put his question with a guarded look, and was not
surprised when his wife quickly replied:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Gracious, no. I’d never dare.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, I presume not. I don’t know who would,
unless it might be Connie.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair was silent for a while in the trouble
that was all the more serious because they dared not
recognize its seriousness, and then she asked:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Couldn’t you help him to something?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t know what,” the judge replied.
“There’s really no opening in a little town.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“If you were off the bench and back in the practice—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Great heavens!” he interrupted her. “Don’t
mention such a thing!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I meant that you might take him in with you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’d be looking around for some one to take me
in,” the judge said. “I’m glad I haven’t the problem
to face.” He enjoyed for a moment the snug
sense he had in his own position and then he
sighed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He’s young, he has that, anyway. He’ll work it
out somehow, I suppose, though I don’t know how.
As for us, all we can do is to have patience, and
wait.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, that’s all,” said Mrs. Blair. “I don’t believe
in long engagements.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How long has it been?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Nearly a year now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I thought it had been ten.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair laughed as she said: “Connie was
wishing this morning that he’d marry her and get
it over with.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />AN ADVERTISEMENT OF DESTINY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The first days of spring contrasted strongly
with Marley’s mood. Because of some mysterious
similarity in the two seasons he found
the melancholy suggestion of fall in this spring,
just as, with his high-flown hopes, he had
found some of the joyous suggestion of spring in
the autumn before. But as failure followed failure,
he began to feel more and more an alien in Macochee;
he had a sense of exile among his own kind,
he was tortured by the thought that here, in a
world where each man had some work to do and
where, as it seemed, all men had suddenly grown
happy in that work, there was no work for him to
do.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was young, healthy, and ambitious; he had
given years to what he had been taught was a
necessary preparation, and then suddenly, just as
he felt himself ready for life, he found that
there was no place in life for him. As he went
about seeking employment there was borne in on
him a sense of criticism and opposition, and he was
depressed and humiliated. By the end of the winter
he disliked showing himself anywhere; he no longer
stopped in the McBriar House of an afternoon to
watch Lawrence and Halliday at the billiards they
played so well; he thought he detected a coolness in
Lawrence’s treatment of him. He felt, or imagined,
this coolness in everybody’s attitude now,
and finally began to suspect it in the Blairs.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What’s the matter?” asked Powell, one morning.
“You ain’t sick, are you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley shook his head.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, something ails you. I can see that.” He
waited for Marley to speak. “Is there anything I
can do for you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” said Marley, “thank you. I’ve just been
feeling a little bit blue, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“What about?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I don’t know. I’m kind o’ discouraged. It
seems to me that I’m wasting time; I’m not making
any headway and then everybody in town is—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I wouldn’t mind that,” said Powell, divining
the trouble at once. “They’ve had me on the gridiron
for about forty years, and they never get tired
of giving it a twist. It doesn’t bother me much
any more, and I don’t see why you should let it
bother you, especially as all they say about you is a
damn lie.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The speech touched Marley, and he lost himself
in an impulse of sympathy for Powell, but he
could not put his sympathy before Powell in the
way he would like and his mind soon returned to
himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve got to do something,” he said. “I wish I
knew what.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” said Powell, “you know what I’ve always
told you. I know what I’d do if I were your
age. Of course—”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell did not finish his sentence. He was looking
out the window again, lost in introspection.</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell’s reiteration of his old advice expressed
the very thought that had been nebulous in Marley’s
mind for days, and while he was conscious of
it, he feared the consciousness, and struggled to
prevent it from positing itself. But now that
Powell had voiced it for him, he could escape it no
longer, and it filled him with a fear. He went
about all the day with this fear appalling him;
more and more under its perverse influence he felt
himself an alien, and the people he met in the street
seemed unreal and strange, outlandish persons
whom he had never known. They came upon him as
ghosts, or if they did something to prove their reality,
he seemed to be some ghost himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the afternoon he received a note from Lavinia;
she said that she was going that evening with
George Halliday to a concert in the Opera House.
She did not want to go a bit, she said, but her
mother, and especially her father, had urged her to
go; arguing that she now went out so seldom that it
must do her good, and besides, they had urged her
so often that she felt it to be her duty in this instance;
she had held out as long as she could, and
then had yielded.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley tried to look upon the note reasonably;
he could see the influence that had compelled Lavinia
to go, and he knew he had no right to blame
her, and yet, try as he would, he could not escape a
feeling of bitterness. When he went home at evening
his mother instantly noticed his depression,
and implored him for the reason. He did not answer
for a while, that is, it seemed a while to Mrs.
Marley, but at last he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Mother, I’ve got to leave.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Leave?” she repeated, pronouncing the word in
a hollow note of fear.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, leave.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But what for?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, you know I’m no good; I’m making no
headway; there’s no place for me here in Macochee;
I’ve got to get out into the world and <em>make</em> a place
for myself, somewhere.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But where?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t know—anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley moved his hand in a wide gesture that
included the whole world, and yet was without hope
of conquest.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But you must have some plans—some idea—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’ve thought of going to Cincinnati;
maybe to Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But what will you do?” Mrs. Marley looked at
him with pain and alarm.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do!” he said, his voice rising almost angrily.
“Why, anything I can get to do. Anything, anything,
sweeping streets, digging ditches, anything!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Marley looked at her son, sitting there before
her with his head bowed in his hands. In her
own face were reflected the pain and trouble that
darkened his, and yet she felt herself helpless; she
vaguely realized that he was engaged in a battle
that he must after all fight alone; she could not
help him, though she wished that she knew how to
impart to him the faith she had that he would
win the battle, somehow, in the end.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Poor boy!” she said at length, rising; “you are
not yourself just now. Think it all over and talk
to your father about it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>It was the first evening in months that Marley
had not spent with Lavinia, and his existence being
now so bound up with hers, he found that he could
not spend the evening as the other young men in
town spent their evenings. However, he went
down to the McBriar House and there a long bill
hanging on the wall instantly struck his eye. The
bill announced an excursion to Chicago. It took
away his breath; he stood transfixed before it,
fascinated and yet repelled; he read it through a
dozen times. The cheerful way in which the railroad
held out this trip intensified his own gloom; he
wondered how he might escape, but there was no
way; it was plainly the revelation of his destiny,
prophetic, absolute, final, and he bowed before it as
to a decree of fate; he knew now that he must go.</p>

<p class='c003'>As he went home, as he walked the dark streets
in the air that was full of the balm of the coming
spring, he felt as one to whom a great sorrow had
come. He thought of leaving Macochee, of leaving
his father and mother, and then, more than all, of
leaving Lavinia, and his throat ached with the
pain of parting that, even now, before any of his
plans had been made, began to assail him. His
plans were nothing now; they had become the
merest details; the great decision had been reached,
not by him, but for him; the destiny toward which
all the lines of his existence for months had been
converging, was on him, the moment had arrived,
and he had a sense of being the mute and helpless
victim of forces that were playing with him,
hurrying him along to a future as dark as the moonless
night above him.</p>

<p class='c003'>He told his father of the excursion, though he
gave him no notion of it as an expression of his
fate, and he was all the more distressed at the calm
way in which his father acquiesced in what he put
before him as a decision he would have liked to
have appear as less final. His father in his mildness
could not object to his trying, and he would
provide the money for the experiment. It gave
Marley a moment’s respite to have his father speak
of it as an experiment, for that included the possibility
of failure, and hence of his return home,
but this meager consolation was immediately dissipated
in the surer sense he felt that this was the
end—the end of Macochee, the end of home, and
the beginning of a new life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />THE BREAK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley went to Lavinia the next morning,
and told her as they sat there on the veranda in
the spring sunlight. She looked at him with distress
in her wide blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“When?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“To-night!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Tonight? Oh Glenn!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Her eyes had filled with tears, and she was winking
hard to keep them back.</p>

<p class='c003'>“To-night.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She repeated the word over and over again.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And to think,” she managed to say at last, “to
think that the last night I should have been away
from you! How can I ever forgive myself!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Her lip trembled, and the tears rolled down her
cheeks. She drew out her handkerchief and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Let’s go in.”</p>

<p class='c003'>All that day Marley went about faltering over his
preparations. Wade Powell was the only one of
the few who were interested in him that was enthusiastic
over his going, and he praised and congratulated
him, and pierced his already sore heart by
declaring that he had known all along it was what
Marley would be compelled to do. He would give
him a letter to his old friend, Judge Johnson, he
said; the judge would be a great man for him to
know, and Powell sat down at once, with more energy
and enterprise than Marley had ever known
him to show, and began to elaborate his letter of introduction.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley dreaded saying good-by; he wished to
shirk it as to Powell as he intended to shirk it in
the cases of his few friends; he was to return to the
office a last time in the afternoon to get the letter;
and then he would bid Powell good-by. He had
the day before him, but that thought could give him
no comfort. He would see Lavinia again in the
afternoon; he would see her once more, for the last
time, in the evening, and in the meantime he would
see his father and his mother, and his home; he had
still two meals to eat with them, but it was as if he
had already gone; there was no reality in his presence
there among them; the blow that fate had decreed
had fallen, and all that was to be was then
actually in being; all about him the men and
women of Macochee were pursuing their ordinary
occupations just as if he were not so soon to go
away and be of this scene no more; a few hours, and
another day, and they would be going on with their
concerns just the same, and he would have disappeared
out of their lives and out of their memories.</p>

<p class='c003'>He looked at everything that had been associated
with his life, and everything called up some
memory,—the little office where he had tried to
study law, the Court House, and the blind goddess
of justice holding aloft her scales, the familiar
Square, the cloaked cavalryman on the monument,
every tree, every fence, every brick in the sidewalk
somehow called out to him—and he was leaving
them all. He looked up and down Main Street,
wide and ugly, littered with refuse, ragged with its
graceless signs; he thought of the people who had
gossiped about him, the people whom he had hated,
but now he could not find in his heart the satisfaction
he had expected in leaving them. He felt tenderly,
almost affectionately, toward them all. But
it was worse at home. He wandered about the
house, looking at every piece of furniture, at every
trinket; he went into the woodshed, and the old ax,
the old saw, everything he had known for years,
wrung his heart; he went to the barn, he looked at
the muddy buggy in which he had driven so often
with his father; he reproached himself because he
had not kept the buggy cleaner for him; he went
into the stall and patted the flank of Dolly, finally
he put his arms about her warm neck, laid his face
against it, and the tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c003'>One of the preachers that were always dropping
in on them was there to dinner, and in the blessing
he invoked on the temporalities, as he called them,
he prayed with professional unction for the son
who was about to leave the old roof-tree, and this
made the ordeal harder for them all. Doctor Marley
spoke to the preacher of little things that he
was to do within the next few days and Marley wondered
how he could mention them, for they were to
be done at a time when he would be there no more.
Because he conceived of life, as all must conceive of
it, solely in its relation to himself, he could not imagine
life going on in Macochee without him.</p>

<p class='c003'>The afternoon wore on, he passed his hour with
Lavinia; they were to meet then but once again; he
returned home, his mother had packed his trunk;
it was waiting. He was tender with his mother,
and he wondered now, with a wild regret, why he
had not always been tender with her; he was tender
now with all things; a tenderness suffused his whole
being; it seemed as if it might dissolve in tears.</p>

<p class='c003'>Still he shrank back; there was one thing more
to do; he was to go up-town and get his ticket, and
the letter to Judge Johnson, and bid Wade Powell
good-by. A wild hope leaped in his heart; perhaps—but
no, it was irrevocable now. He went,
and got his letter, but Powell refused to bid him
good-by; he said he would be at the train to see him
off. He bought his ticket and went home. Old
man Downing had been there with his dray and
hauled away his trunk; it was settled. He could
only wait and watch the minutes tick by.</p>

<p class='c003'>It seemed to Marley that all things that evening
conspired to accentuate all that he was leaving
behind, and to make the grief of parting more poignant.
His mother, who was then in that domestic
exigency described by the ladies of Macochee as being
without a girl, had prepared an unusually
elaborate supper, and while there was no formal
observance of the fact, it was eaten, so far as any of
them could eat that evening, under a sense of its
significance as a parting ceremonial. They talked,
or tried to talk, indifferently of commonplace
things, and Doctor Marley even sought to add
merriment to their feast by a jocularity that was
unusual with him. Marley, who knew his father
so well, could easily detect the heavy heart that lay
under his father’s jokes, and he suffered a keener
misery from the pathos of it. Then he would
catch his mother looking at him, her eyes deep and
sad, and it seemed to him that his heart must burst.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley’s train was to leave at eleven o’clock; he
had arranged to go to Lavinia’s and remain with
her until ten o’clock; then he was to stop in at his
home for his last good-by. Those last two hours
with Lavinia were an ordeal; into the first hour
they tried to crowd a thousand things they felt they
must say, and a thousand things they could only
suggest; when the clock struck nine, they looked at
each other in anguish; they did little after that
but mentally count the minutes. The clock ticked
loudly, aggressively, until in the soul of each, unconfessed,
there was a desire to hasten the moments
they felt they would like to stay; the agony
was almost beyond endurance; it exhausted them,
beat them down, and rendered them powerless to
speak. Finally the clock struck the half-hour; they
could only sit and look at each other now; at a
quarter of ten they began their good-bys.</p>

<p class='c003'>At ten o’clock Mrs. Blair, Connie and Chad
came into the room solemnly, and bade Marley
farewell; the judge himself came in after them, his
glasses in his hand and the magazine he had been
reading, which, as Marley thought with that pang
of things going on without him, he would in a few
moments be reading again as calmly as ever.
He took Marley’s hand, and wished him success;
for the first time he spoke gently, almost affectionately
to him, and although Marley tried to bear
himself stoically, the judge’s farewell touched him
more than all the others.</p>

<p class='c003'>The shameless children would have liked to
remain and see the tragedy to its close, but Mrs. Blair
drew them from the room with her. The last moment
had come, and Marley held Lavinia in his
arms; at last he tore himself from her, and it was
over. He looked back from out the darkness;
Lavinia was still standing in the doorway; he saw
her slender, girlish figure outlined against the hall
light behind her; somehow he knew that she was
bravely smiling through her tears. She stood
there until his footfall sounded loud in the spring
night, then the light went out, the door closed as he
had heard it close so often, and she was gone.</p>

<p class='c003'>He saw the light in his father’s study as he approached
his home, and there came again that torturing
sense: the sermon his father then was working
on would be preached when he was far away;
his mother, as he knew by the light in the sitting-room
window, was waiting for him; she had waited
there so many nights, and now she was waiting for
the last time. She rose at his step, and took him to
her arms the minute he entered the door.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Be brave, dear,” he said, stroking her gray
hair; “be brave.” He was trying so hard to be
brave himself, and she was crying. He had not
often seen her cry. She could not speak for many
minutes; she could only pat him on the shoulder
where her head lay.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Remember, my precious boy,” she managed to
say at last, “that there’s a strong Arm to lean
upon.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He saw that she was turning now to the great
faith that had sustained her in every trial of a life
that had known so many trials; and the tears
came to his own eyes. He would have left her for
a moment but she followed him. He had an impulse
he could not resist to torture himself by going
over the house again; he went into the dining-room
which in the darkness wore an air of waiting for
the breakfast they would eat when he was gone; he
went to the kitchen and took a drink of water,
from the old habit he was now breaking; then
he went up stairs and looked into his own room,
at the neatly made bed where he was to sleep no
more; at last he stood at the door of the study.</p>

<p class='c003'>He could catch the odor of his father’s cigar, just
as he had in standing there so many times before;
he pushed the door open and felt the familiar hot,
close, smoke-laden atmosphere which his father
seemed to find so congenial to his studies. Doctor
Marley took off his spectacles and pushed his manuscript
aside, and Marley felt that he never would
forget that picture of the gray head bent in its
earnest labors over that worn and littered desk; it
was photographed for all time on his memory. His
words with his father had always been few; there
were no more now.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, father,” he said, “I’ve come to say good-by.”</p>

<p class='c003'>His father pushed back his chair and turned
about. He half-rose, then sank back again and took
his son’s hand.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Good-by, Glenn,” he said. “You’ll write?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Write often. We’ll want to hear.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, write often,” the doctor said. “And take
care of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I will, father.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Wait a moment.” Doctor Marley was fumbling
in his pocket. He drew forth a few dollars.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here, Glenn,” he said. “I wish it could be
more.”</p>

<p class='c003'>There was nothing more to do, or say. They
went down stairs; Marley’s bag was waiting for
him in the hall. He kissed his mother again and
then again; he shook his father’s hand, and then he
went.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Write often,” his father called out to him, as
he went down the walk. It was all the old man
could say.</p>

<p class='c003'>The door closed, as the door of the Blairs’ had
closed. Inside Doctor Marley looked at his wife a
moment.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” he said, “he’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Marley made no answer.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I suppose,” he said, “I ought to have gone to
the train with him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Then he toiled up the stairs to his study and the
sermon he was to preach when Glenn was gone.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley walked rapidly down Market Street toward
the depot; in the dark houses that suddenly
had taken on a new significance to him, people were
sleeping, people who would awake the next morning
in Macochee. He could not escape the torture
of this thought; his mind revolved constantly about
the mystery of his being still in Macochee, still
within calling distance, almost, of Lavinia, of his
father and mother, of all he loved in life, when in
reality they had in an instant become as inaccessible
to him as though the long miles of his exile
already separated them.</p>

<p class='c003'>Twenty minutes later, Lavinia, in her room,
Mrs. Marley, at her prayers, and Doctor Marley
sitting in deep absorption at his desk, heard the sonorous
whistle of a locomotive sound ominously
over the dark and quiet town.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />THE GATES OF THE CITY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was a relief to Marley when morning came
and released him from the reclining chair that
had held his form so rigidly all the night. He
had not taken a sleeper because he felt himself too
poor, and he had somewhere got the false impression
that comfort was to be had in the chair car.
He had stretched himself in the cruel rack when
the porter came through and turned the lights down
to the dismal point of gloom, but he had not slept;
all through the night the trainmen constantly
passed through the car talking with each other in
low tones; the train, too, made long, inexplicable
stops; he could hear the escape of the weary engine,
through his window he could see the lights of
some strange town; and then the trainmen would
run by outside, swinging their lanterns in the
darkness, and calling to each other, and Marley would
fear that something had happened, or else was
about to happen, which was worse.</p>

<p class='c003'>Finally the train would creak on again, as if it
were necessary to proceed slowly and cautiously
through vague dangers of the night. Through his
window he could see the glint of rails, the two
yards of gleaming steel that traveled always abreast
of him. Toward morning Marley wearily fell
asleep, and then the sorrow and heart-ache of his
parting from Lavinia and his home distorted themselves
in fearful dreams.</p>

<p class='c003'>When he awoke at last, and looked out on the
ugly prairie that had nothing to break its monotony
but a few scraggly scrub-oak bushes, and some
clumps of stunted trees, the dawn was descending
from the gray sky. The car presented a squalid,
hideous sight; all about him were stretched the
bodies of sleeping passengers, flaccid, inert, having
cast aside in utter weariness all sense of decency
and shame; the men had pulled off their
boots, and sprawled on the chairs, their stockinged
feet prominently in view; women lay with open
mouths, their faces begrimed, their hair in slovenly
disarray.</p>

<p class='c003'>The baby that had been crying in the early part
of the night had finally gone to sleep while nursing,
and its tired mother slept with it at her
breast. The Jewish drummer across the aisle was
sleeping in shirt-sleeves; his head had rolled
from the little rest on the back of his chair and now
lolled off his shoulder, his sallow face turned
toward Marley was greasy with perspiration; his
closed eyes filled out their blue hemispherical lids,
and his cheeks puffed with his intermittent snoring.
At times his snoring grew so loud and so
troubled that it seemed as if he must choke; he
would reach a torturing climax, then suddenly the
thick red lips beneath his black mustache would
open, his sallow cheeks would collapse, and relief
would come.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley wished the passengers would wake up
and end the indecencies they had tried to hide
earlier in the night. Glancing up and down the
long car he could recognize none of them as having
been there when he had boarded the car at
Macochee; those who had got on with him had gone
short distances, and then got off, breaking the last
tie that bound him to his home. He found it impossible
now to conceive of the car as having been in
Macochee so short a time before.</p>

<p class='c003'>Presently he saw an old lady sitting up in the
remote end of the car; she was winding her thin
wisp of gray hair in a little knob at the back of her
head. Then, feeling that he might bestir himself,
Marley got up and went forward; he washed his
face, and tried to escape the discomfort of clothes
he had worn all the night by readjusting them.
The train was evidently approaching the city; now
and then he saw a building, lonely and out of place:
on the hideous sand-dunes, as if it waited for the
city, in the growth it boasted, to catch up with it.</p>

<p class='c003'>The train ran on; it had reached an ever-widening
web of tracks; it passed long lines of freight-cars,
stock-cars from the west, empty gondolas that
had come with coal from the Hocking Valley; a
switch tower swept by, its bell jangling peevishly in
alarm; long processions of working-men trooped
with their dinner-pails between the tracks. The
train stopped, finally, still far from its destination.
The air in the car was foul from the feculence of
all those bodies that had lain in it through the
night, and Marley went out on the platform. He
could hear the engine wheezing—the only sound to
break the silence of the dawn. The cool morning
air was grateful to Marley, though it was not the
air of the spring they were already having in
Macochee. He risked getting down off the platform
and looked ahead. Beyond the long train,
coated with its black cinders, he saw Chicago, dim
through the morning light, lying dark, mysterious
and grim under its pall of smoke. He shuddered
and went back into the car. After a while the
train creaked and strained and pulled on again.</p>

<p class='c003'>The passengers had begun to stir, and now were
hastening to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of
the world; the woman with the baby fastened her
dress, the drummer put on his collar and coat, the
men drew on their boots, but it was long before they
felt themselves presentable again. The women
could achieve but half a toilet, and though they
were all concerned about their hair, they could not
make themselves tidy.</p>

<p class='c003'>The train was running swiftly, now that it was
in the city, where it seemed it should have run more
slowly; the newsboy came in with the morning papers,
followed by the baggage agent with his jingling
bunch of brass checks. The porter doffed his
white jacket and donned his blue, and waited now
for the end of his labors, so near at hand. He made
no pretense of brushing his passengers, for those in
his charge were plainly not of the kind with tips to
bestow.</p>

<p class='c003'>As the train rushed over unknown streets, Marley
caught visions of the crowds blockaded by the crossing
gates, street-cars already filled with people,
empty trucks going after the great loads under
which they would groan all the day; and people,
people, people, ready for the new day of toil that
had come to the earth.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last the train drew up under the black shed of
the Union Station, and Marley stood with the
passengers that huddled at the door of the car. He
went out and down; he joined the crowd that passed
through the big iron gates into the station; and
then he turned and glanced back for one last look at
the train that had brought him; only a few hours
before it had been in Macochee; a few hours more
and it would be there again. In leaving the train
he felt that he was breaking the last tie that bound
him to Macochee, and he would have liked to linger
and gaze on it. But a man in a blue uniform, with
the official surliness, ordered him not to hold back
the crowd. He climbed the steps, went out into
Canal Street, ran the gantlet of the cabmen, and
was caught up in the crowd and swept across the
bridge into Madison Street.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was in Chicago, and here among these thousands
of people, each hurrying along through the
sordid crowd to his own task, here in this hideous,
cruel city, he must make a place for himself, and
gain the foothold from which he could fight his battle
for existence in the world.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />LETTERS HOME</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“How does she seem since he went away?”
asked Judge Blair of his wife two days after
Marley had gone. He spoke in his usual habit
of deference to his wife’s observation, though his
own opportunities for observing Lavinia might
have been considered as great as hers.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I haven’t noticed any difference in her,” said
Mrs. Blair, and then she added a qualifying and
significant “yet.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” observed the judge, “I presume it’s too
early. Has she heard from him?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“She had a letter this morning; that is, I suppose
it was from him; she ran to meet the postman,
and then went up stairs.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You didn’t mention it to her?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair looked at her husband in surprise, and
he hastened to make amends by acquiescing in the
propriety of her conduct, when he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, of course not.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He seemed to drop the subject then, but that it
remained uppermost in his mind was shown later,
when he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I think she will be weaned away from him after
a while, don’t you? That is—if he stays long
enough.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair was not so hopeful; perhaps, too, in
her romantic ideal of devotion, she did not wish
Lavinia to be weaned away. But she avoided a direct
answer by the suggestion:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Perhaps he will be weaned away from her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>This possibility had not occurred to the judge.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, the idea!” he said resentfully. “Do you
think him capable of such baseness?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair laughed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Would you like to think of <em>your</em> daughter as
fickle, and forgetting a young man who was eating
his heart out for her far away in a big city?”</p>

<p class='c003'>A condition of such mild romantic sorrow might
have attracted Mrs. Blair in the abstract, but it
could not of course appeal to her when it came thus
personally. As for the judge, he dismissed the
problem, as he had so many times before, with the
remark:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, we can only wait and see.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The letter which Lavinia received from Marley
had been written the day he reached Chicago. It
was a long letter, conceived largely in a facetious
spirit, and he had labored over it far into the
night in the little room of the boarding-house he
had found in Ohio Street.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I chose Ohio Street,” he wrote, “because its
name reminded me of home. Ohio Street may once
have been the street of the well-born, but it has degenerated
and it is now the abode of a long row of
boarding—places, one of which houses me. My room
is a little corner eyrie in the second story, back,
and from its one window I get an admirable view
of the garbage dump, the atmosphere and certain
intensely red bricks which go to make the wall of
the house next door. And my landlady, ah, I
should have to be a Balzac to describe my landlady!
She wears large, vociferous ear-rings, and she says
‘y-e-e-a-a-s’ for yes; just kind o’ rolls it off her
tongue as if she didn’t care whether it ever got off
or not. She is truly a beauteous lady, given much
to a scarlet hue of her nasal appendage; also, her
molar system is unduly prominent, too much to the
fore, as it were. As for form or figure, I’m afraid
I couldn’t say with truth that she goes in for the
sinuous, far from it; she leans more to the elephantine
style of feminine architecture. And she
has a way of reaching out that is very attractive;
probably because of the necessity of reaching for
room rent. She bears the air of one bent on no
earthly thing, of a continual soaring in quest of the
unexpected; there is about her the charm of the intangible,
the unknowable.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The boarding-house itself isn’t so bad; I get my
room and two meals for three-fifty a week; my
noon luncheons I have to take down-town. They
have dinner here, you know, in the evening. I
haven’t seen much of the people in the boarding-house;
the men are mostly clerks, and the women
have bleached hair. They all looked at me when I
went into the dining-room this evening. There is
one young man who sits at my table who is in truth
a very unwise and immature youth. He is given
greatly to the use of words of awful and bizarre
make-up. For instance, he said something about
the jokes they get off in the shows here about Irishmen,
but instead of saying jokes, he said ‘traversities’!
What do you think of that?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley had already described his journey to
Chicago in terms similar to those in which he described
his boarding-house; of Chicago itself he
said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“It seems that ages ago when the gods, or maybe
the demons, were making over plans and specifications
of the infernal region, Chicago was mentioned
and considered by the committee. When it came to
a vote for choice of sites the place that won had only
three more votes than Chicago. They didn’t locate
the brimstone plant here, and from what I can
learn Chicago was a candidate for both the plant
and the honor. It was a mistake on somebody’s
part, as Chicago is certainly an ideal place for it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But the letter discussed mostly the things of
Macochee, where Marley’s spirit still dwelt. The
passages Lavinia most liked, of course, were those
in which he declared his love for her; it was the
first love-letter she had ever received, and this
tender experience went far to compensate her for the
loneliness she felt in his absence.</p>

<p class='c003'>It grew upon her after she had read her letter
many times, that it would be a kindness to take it
over and read to Mrs. Marley those parts, at
least, that were not personal. It was a hard thing
for Lavinia to do; she had a fear of Mrs. Marley;
but she felt more and more the kindness of it, and
so in the morning she set out. Lavinia was surprised
and a little disappointed, when Mrs. Marley
told her that she too had received in the same mail
a letter from Glenn. It somehow took away from
her own act, the more when Mrs. Marley calmly
passed her letter over for Lavinia to read.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia, who had not been able to resist a pang
that Marley had written his mother quite as
promptly as he had written her, found some consolation
in the fact that his letter to his mother was
not nearly so long as his letter to her, and it contained,
too, the same information; in some instances,
identical phrases, as letters do that are written
at the same time. She felt that she should be
happy in them both, and she wished she could determine
which of the letters had been written first.
After she had read Mrs. Marley’s letter, she could
not speak for a moment; the letter closed with a description
of the sensations it gave Marley to open
his trunk and come across the Bible his mother had
packed in it. But she controlled herself, and when
she had finished reading parts of her own letter to
Mrs. Marley, she said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, he seems to be in good spirits, doesn’t he?
He writes so amusingly of everything.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Marley looked up at Lavinia with a curious
smile.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, don’t you see?” she said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What?” asked Lavinia, glancing in alarm at the
two letters which she still held in her lap.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, the poor boy is dying of homesickness;
that’s what makes him write in that mocking vein.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you think that is so?” Lavinia leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, I know it,” replied Mrs. Marley, with a
little laugh. “He’s just like his father.”</p>

<p class='c003'>For a moment Lavinia felt a satisfaction in
Marley’s loneliness, but she denied the satisfaction
when she said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“He’ll get over it, after a while.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Not for a long while, I’m afraid,” said Mrs.
Marley. “Not until some one can be with him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia blushed, and before she knew it Mrs.
Marley had bent over and kissed her cheek.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He has a long hard battle before him, my dear,”
she said, “in a great cruel city. We must help him
all we can.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia hesitated a moment, then she put her
arms about Mrs. Marley and drew her down for the
kiss which sealed their friendship.</p>

<p class='c003'>They sat and talked of Marley for a long time,
and at last when Lavinia rose to go, she held out to
Mrs. Marley the letter her son had written her.
She looked at it a moment before handing it to Mrs.
Marley.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Would you like to keep it?” Mrs. Marley asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“May I?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“If you wish. But you must come often; I shall
be lonely now, you know, and you must bring his
letters and read parts of them. He’ll be writing
so many more to you than he will to me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia received a letter from Marley every day;
it was not long before Clemmons, the postman,
smiled significantly when, each morning at the
sound of his whistle, she ran to meet him at the
door. And Lavinia wrote to Marley as regularly
herself, sitting at the little desk in her room every
night long after the house was dark and still.</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge could find no hope in the observations
Mrs. Blair reported to him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She seems to have developed a new idea of
constancy,” said Mrs. Blair. “She will not allow
herself to do a thing, or go to a single place; she
will hardly accept any pleasure because he isn’t
here to share it. I believe she tries not to have a
thought that is not of him. She is almost fanatical
about it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh dear!” said the judge. “I thought the
nightly calls were a severe strain, but they can not
compare to the strain of nightly letters.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He writes excellent letters, however,” Mrs.
Blair said. “I wish you could read the one he
wrote his mother. A boy who writes like that to
his mother—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“How did you get to see a letter he wrote his
mother?” interrupted the judge.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Lavinia showed it to me.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Has she been over there?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes. Why?”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge shook his head gravely, as if the situation
were now hopeless, indeed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />THE ARMY OF THE UNEMPLOYED</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I am very tired to-night,” Marley wrote to
Lavinia a day or so later. “I have been making
the rounds of the law offices; I have been
to all the leading firms, but—here I am, still
without a place. I thought I might get a place in
one of them where I could finish my law studies,
and make enough to live on, meanwhile; I had
dreams of working into the firm in time, but they
were only dreams, and all my hopes have gone
glimmering. The men who are employed in the law
offices are already admitted to the bar; most of
them are young fellows, but some are old and gray-headed,
and the sight of them gave me the blues.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I did not get to see many of the firm members
themselves; their offices are formidable places.
There is no office in Macochee like them; they have
big outer rooms, full of stenographers and clerks
and there is a boy at a desk who makes you tell your
business before you can get in to see any of the
lawyers themselves. They seem to be mighty big,
important fellows. Most of them would not see me
at all; several said they had no place for me and
dismissed me with a kind of pitying smile; one
man, when I asked him if he thought there was an
opening, said he supposed there ought to be, as one
lawyer in Chicago had died of starvation only the
day before. But some were kinder; one, whom I
shall never forget, took pains to sit down and talk
with me a long time, but he was no more encouraging
than the others. He said the profession
was terribly overcrowded, ‘that is,’ he corrected
himself with a tired smile, ‘if you can call it a profession
any longer. It is more of a business nowadays
and the only ones who get ahead are those who
have big corporations for clients. How they all live
is a mystery to me!’ He thought I had better not
undertake it and advised me to go into some
business. But then most of them did that.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I must tell you of my visit to Judge Johnson.
You will remember my telling you of him;
he was Wade Powell’s chum in the law school in
Cincinnati, and Mr. Powell had given me a letter
to him. I had a hard time seeing him; the hardest
of all. When I went into the big stone government
building he was holding court, and a lawyer was
making an argument before him. I waited till they
were all done, and then when the crier had adjourned
court—he said ‘Oyez, Oyez, Oyez,’ instead
of the ‘Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye’ we have in Ohio;
it sounded so old and quaint, even if he did say
‘Oh yes,’ for ‘Oyez!’ It comes from the old Norman-French,
you know; ask your father about it,
he’ll explain it—I tried to get in to him. I succeeded
at last, but it was hard work. He didn’t
seem glad to see me; he looked at me coldly, and
made me feel as if I ought to hurry up and state my
business promptly and get away. When I gave him
Wade Powell’s letter he put on his gold glasses and
read it; but—what do you think?—I don’t believe
he remembered Wade Powell at all! At least he
seemed not to. Of course he may have been putting
it on. Wouldn’t it make Wade Powell mad to
know that? I’d give a dollar—and I haven’t any to
spare either—to see him when he hears that his old
friend, Judge Johnson of the United States Circuit
Court, couldn’t remember him! Well, the
judge didn’t let me detain him long, he looked at
his watch a moment, and then he advised me not
to try it in Chicago; he said there were too many
lawyers here anyhow, and that he thought a young
man made a mistake in coming to a city at all.</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘Why don’t you stay in a small town?’ he
asked, looking at me sternly over his glasses. ‘Living
is cheaper there, and life is much more simple
than it is in the cities. I’ve often wished I had
stayed in a little town.’</p>

<p class='c003'>“I came away, as you can imagine, feeling pretty
much cast down and humbled in spirit. There are
four thousand lawyers in Chicago; just think of it,
almost as many lawyers as there are people in
Macochee! As I walked through the crowded
streets with men and women rushing along, I
wondered how they all lived. What do they do?
Where are they all going, and how do they get a
place to stand on? As I came across the bridge
over to the North Side I felt that there was no
place for me here in this great, dirty, ugly city,
just as there is no place for me back in peaceful
Macochee, where every minute of the day I long to
be. Anyway, I am sure that there is no place for
me here in the law, and I shall have to look for
something else. I see so much wretchedness and
poverty and squalor; it is in the street everywhere—pale,
gaunt men, who look at you out of
sick, appealing eyes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“This morning I saw a sight down-town that
filled me with horror; it was noon, and a great
crowd of ragged men were waiting in front of the
<em>Daily News</em> office in Fifth Avenue. They were all
standing idly and yet expectantly about; I stood
and watched them. Presently, as at some signal,
they all rushed for the office door, and then all at
once they seemed to be enveloped in a white, rustling
cloud. Each one had a newspaper, and they all
turned to one page and began to read rapidly; sometimes
two or three men bent over the same paper; in
another moment they had scattered, going in all directions.
Then it flashed upon me: they had been
waiting for the noon edition of the paper and the
page they had all turned to was the page with the
‘want ads’ on it; they were all looking for jobs! It
made me inexpressibly sad. I do not wish to inflict
my own sorrow upon you, dear heart, but it made
me shudder; what if I—but no, the thought is too
horrible to mention. And yet I, too, belong to this
great army of the unemployed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“As I write the clock in the steeple of a church
a block away chimes the hour of midnight; so you
see that I’ve retained my nocturnal habits. When
the poets of a coming generation sing of me (as
they doubtless will, after my death) their songs
will be called Nocturnes.”</p>

<p class='c003'>That same day Doctor Marley received a letter
from his son which Mrs. Marley, though her husband
passed it over to her to read, did not show
to Lavinia. It ran:</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s rather expensive living here, I find; especially
for one who belongs to the great army of the
unemployed. My contract with my basiliscine
landlady calls for two meals a day and a bed at
night—also for three-fifty per week in payment of
said two meals and bed. My lunches I get down-town;
that is, I did get them down-town; for two
days I have gone without lunches, and the aforesaid
landlady looks reproachfully at me at night when
she sees me laying in an extra supply of dinner. I
don’t mind the lack of the lunches, even if she
does, but I’ll have to pay her in a day or so now.
I’m in poor spirits to-night, so can’t write well;
cause of said low mental temperature, only eighty
cents in the world between me, my landlady and
ultimate starvation. It’s funny how much hungrier
a fellow gets as the food supply gets low.
A word to the wise, etc.</p>

<p class='c003'>“What do you think? I met Charlie Davis
on the street this morning. He is living here now,
working in some big department store. My, it was
good to see some one from Macochee! How small
the world is, after all!</p>

<p class='c003'>“How are you all? How is Dolly? Does Smith
Johnson still clap his hands at his dog every evening
as he comes home, and does the dog run out
to meet him as joyously as of yore? And does
Hank Delphy still go down-town in his shirt-sleeves?
And has Charlie Fouly had any fits in the
Square lately? And, father, has mother got a girl
yet? Give her an ocean of love and tell her not to
work too hard, and to let the heathen shift for
themselves a while. They haven’t any trusts to
monopolize the jobs as yet, and they ought to be
able to get along. Oh, how I’d like to see you
all! Answer all my questions: I propounded numerous
ones to you. I don’t remember now what
all of them were, but I know they were all momentous
and had much to do with my well-being, spiritual
and physical, not to say financial. And see
that the moss doesn’t get too thickly overlaid on
my memory.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley’s new life in Chicago, as somewhat
vaguely reflected in his letters, impressed those
who had a sense of having been left behind in Macochee,
as but a continuation of the life he had led
there, that is, it was presented to them as one long,
hopeless search for employment. He told of his
daily tramps up and down the city, of his dutiful
applications for work in every place where the boon
of work might be bestowed, and of the unvarying
refusals of those in whose hands had been intrusted,
by some inscrutable decree of the providence of
economics, the right to control the opportunity
of labor. It was as if the primal curse of earning
his bread were in a fair way to be taken from
man, had not the primal necessity of eating his
bread continued unabated.</p>

<p class='c003'>The routine through which he went each day
had begun to weary Marley, and it might have begun
to weary his readers in Macochee, had they
not all felt their own fortunes somehow bound up
with his. He apologized in his nightly letters for
the monotony of their recitals, but he hoped it
might be condoned as the most realistic portrayal
of his life that he could give. He tried at times
to give his letters a lighter tone by describing, with
a facility that grew with practice, the many incidents
that attracted him in a city whose life was
all so new and strange to him; he could not help
a growing interest in it all, and while Lavinia was
probably unconscious of the change, his letters
were now less concerned with the things of the life
he had left in Macochee, and more and more with
the things of the life he had entered upon in Chicago;
as on a palimpsest, the old impressions were
erased to make way for new ones.</p>

<p class='c003'>But try as he would to give to his letters a cheer
that was far from expressing his own spirit, he
could not save them from the despair that was
laying hold of him, a despair which finally communicated
itself in the declaration that it was now
no longer with him a question of selecting employment.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I must take,” he wrote, “whatever I can get,
and that will probably be some kind of manual, if
not menial, work. Sometimes,” so he let himself go
on, “I feel as if I would give up and go back to
Macochee, defeated and done for. But I can not
come to that yet, though I would like to; oh, how
I would like to! But I don’t dare, my pride won’t
let me act the part of a coward, though I know I
am one at heart. One thing keeps me up and that
is the thought of you; I see your face ever before
me, and your sweet eyes ever smiling at me—”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia’s eyes were not smiling as she read this;
and she poured out her own grief and sympathy in
a long letter that she promptly tore up, to pen in
its stead a calmer, braver one, that should hearten
him in the struggle which, as she proudly assured
him, he was making for her.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley’s description of his straits partly prepared
Lavinia for the shock of the letter in which
he said he had found a job at last, but she was
hardly prepared to learn that it was anything so far
from her conception of what was due him as a
job trucking freight for a railroad. The mockery
he put into the picture of himself in a blue jumper
and overalls could not console her, and she kept
the truth from every one, except her mother; she
preferred rather that they number Marley still with
the army of the unemployed than to count him
among those who toiled so desperately with the
muscles of their arms and backs. She tried to conceal
in encouraging congratulations the chagrin of
which she felt she should be ashamed, and she
tried to show her appreciation of his droll sarcasms
about the preparation his four years of college had
given him for the task of trundling barrels of
sugar and heaving pianos down from box-cars.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m sure it’s honest work,” she wrote, “but
do be careful, dear, not to hurt yourself in lifting
such heavy loads.” It was a comfort to remind
him that he was not intended to do such work.</p>

<p class='c003'>There was a relief, however, that she did not dare
admit, when he told her three days later that he
had lost his job.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I realize for the first time my importance in
the great scheme of things,” he wrote. “I was
fired because I do not belong to the freight
handlers’ union. It took them three days to find this
out, and then they threatened to strike if the railroad
company did not immediately discharge me.
The railroad company, after due consideration,
decided to let me out, and—I’m out. It makes me
tremble to think of the consequences that would
have followed had they decided otherwise. Think
of it! The railroad tied up, business at a standstill
and the commerce of the nation paralyzed,
and all because of Glenn Marley, A. B. It is
really encouraging to know that my presence on
the earth is actually known to my fellow-mortals;
it has at least been discovered that I am alive and
in Chicago, even if my diploma is not recognized by
Freight Handlers’ Union No. 63. And now,” he
concluded, “as Kipling says, it’s ‘back to the army
again, Sergeant, back to the army again’—the
army of the unemployed.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia was shocked again a day or so later
when on opening her letter she met the announcement
that he had been offered a job with another
railroad as a freight handler.</p>

<p class='c003'>“But you need not be alarmed,” she was reassured
to read—though it was not until she thought
it all over afterward that she began to wonder how
he had divined her dislike of his being in such
work—“I haughtily declined, and turned them
down. You see this road is just now in the throes
of a strike, and all their freight handlers are out.
Consequently, they have had to employ scabs to do
the work of the strikers. They take anybody—that’s
why they were ready to take me. But as I
said, I declined. Somehow, I couldn’t bring myself
to take a place away from a union man.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia mistook her satisfaction in Marley’s declination
of the position for a satisfaction in the
nobility of his sacrifice, and in her elation she related
the circumstance at dinner. Now that Marley
had declined such an employment she felt safe in
doing this. But her father did not see it in her
light, or at least in Marley’s light.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Humph!” he sneered; “so he sympathizes with
unionism, does he? Well, those unions will own
the whole earth if they keep on.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But he says he thought of the wives and children
of the union men—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, but why doesn’t he think of the wives and
children of the scabs, as he calls them? They have
as much right to live and work as the union
men.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia, as an opponent of union labor herself,
could not answer this argument, though she
felt it her duty to defend Marley. But before
she could proceed in his defense, her father,
strangely enraged at the mere mention of the policies
of the unions, hurried on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“The union didn’t show any consideration for
him when it took his other job away from him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia shot a reproachful glance at her mother,
who did not see it because she was shooting a
glance more than reproachful at her husband, and
it had the effect of silencing and humbling the
judge, as all of Lavinia’s arguments, or all of
the arguments known to the propaganda of union
labor, could not have done.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />A FOOTHOLD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The next letter the postman gave Lavinia began
ecstatically:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve got a job at last! I’m now working for
the C. C. and P. Railroad, in their local
freight office, and I’m not trucking freight either,
but I’m a clerk—a bill clerk, to be more exact.
My duties consist in sitting at a desk and writing
out freight bills, for which by some inscrutable
design of Providence my study of common carriers
and contracts in the law was doubtless intended to
prepare me.</p>

<p class='c003'>“To-day I wrote out a bill for freight to Cook and
Jennings, Macochee, Ohio, and you can imagine
my sensations. It made me homesick for a while;
I wished that by some necromancy I might conceal
myself in the bill and go to Macochee with it;
I had a notion to write a little word of greeting on
the bill, but I didn’t; it might have worried old
man Cook’s brain and he couldn’t stand much of
a strain of that kind. But I’m getting nearer Macochee
every day now. I guess I’m to be a railroad
man after all, and some day you’ll be proud to
tell your friends that I started at the bottom. ‘Oh,
yes,’ you’ll be boasting, ‘Mr. Marley began as a
common freight trucker; and worked his way up to
general manager.’ Then we’ll go back to Macochee
in my private car. I can see it standing down by
the depot, on the side track close to Market Street,
baking in the hot sun, and the little boys from
across the tracks will be crowding about it, gaping
at the white-jacketed darky who’ll be getting the
dinner ready. We’ll have Jack and Mayme down
to dine with us, and your father and mother and
Chad and Connie, and my folks, too, and maybe,
if you’ll let me, Wade Powell. Then, of course,
the Macochee people will think better of me; they
won’t be saying that I’m no good, but instead they’ll
stand around, in an easy, careless way, and say,
‘Oh, yes, I knew Glenn when he was a boy. I
always said he’d get up in the world.’</p>

<p class='c003'>“But, ah me, just now I’m a bill clerk at fifty
dollars a month, thank you, and glad of the chance
to get it; so is my voluptuous landlady glad; she’ll
get her board money a little more regularly now.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I suppose you’ll want to know something about
my surroundings. They are not elegant; the office
is a big barn of a place, crowded full of desks,
where we sit and write from eight in the morning
until any hour at night when it occurs to the boss
to tell us we can go. Last night it was ten o’clock
before the idea struck him. They kindly allow us
an hour in which to run out to a restaurant for
supper. The windows in the office were washed, so
tradition runs, in 1493, the year after Columbus
landed. Outside, the freight trains rush by constantly
so as to keep the noise going. My boss,
whose name is Clark, strikes me as being a sort
of fool of an innocuous sort. He is a conscientious
ass, but a poor, unfortunate, deluded simpleton.
He’s one of those close-fisted reubs whose chief
care is the pennies, and whose only interest in
life is the C. C. and P. Railroad. He makes his
business his own personal affair and the C. C.
and P. his god. He lunches down-town and pays
twenty cents for his lunch, never more, often fifteen.
One of the first things he told me was, now
that I had come under his protecting wing, to begin
to save money. They have a young man in the
office here, whose desk is next to mine, who was born
somewhere in Canada, and is always ’a-servin’ of
her Majesty the Queen,’ as Kipling says. He told
me with much gusto how he had hung out of the
office window last New Year’s a Canadian flag.
He seemed proud of having done so, and also told
me, boasted to me, in fact, that he was going to
hang the same flag out of the same window on the
Fourth of July. ‘Oh, yes, you are!’ thinks I. So
I got the flag and ripped it into shreds and started
it through the waste-basket on a hurried trip to
oblivion. <em>À bas</em> the Canadian flag! He’ll probably
get another one, but if I get hold of it, it’ll
meet the same fate as the first one. Then I have
something to think of that’ll keep my mind off my
horrible fate in being here in Chicago, while I
smile in ghoulish glee with a cynical leer overspreading
my classic features, at the young man’s
disapproval of my actions. The rest of the men in
the office aren’t much to boast of. They’re a
diluted mixture of Nijni Norgordian and Bill Hoffman
the jeweler. I still hate this town; I wish it
were buried under seven hundred and thirty feet
of Lake Michigan.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley’s next letter to Lavinia opened thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Extract from the diary of J. H. Anderson,</div>
      <div class='line'>Esq., Canadian, clerk in the freight office of the</div>
      <div class='line'>C. C. and P. Ry., at Chicago, Ill., April 20.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘New man on desk next to mine; young, about</div>
      <div class='line'>24. Rather decent fellow, but conceited. Do not</div>
      <div class='line'>think he will last. Took me to lunch with him</div>
      <div class='line'>this evening.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>“Now what do you think of that? The youth
I described to you at such length keeps a diary,
and the foregoing is culled therefrom. He left it
by some mistake on top of his desk, and I picked it
up innocently enough to-night, to see what it was,
and that was the first thing my eye lit on. He
is evidently an adept at coming to conclusions, apparently
he can sum one up in two whisks of a porter’s
broom. I was much surprised to find myself
so well done. Done on every side in those few
words. I’ve rather enjoyed it; strikes me as being
uproariously funny. Maybe his dictum is correct.
You’ll agree with me as to his richness. Tell
every one about it and see what they will think.
Tell your mother and my mother. Tell Jack and
give him a chance to laugh. Tell Mayme Carter,
too.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia ran at once to her mother.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Listen,” she said. And she read it.</p>

<p class='c003'>Mrs. Blair laughed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How funny!” she said, “and how well he
writes! I should think he’d go into literature.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia laid the letter down in her lap and
looked at her mother as if she had been startled by a
striking coincidence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, do you know, I’ve thought of that very
thing myself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But read on,” urged Mrs. Blair.</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia picked up the letter again and began:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, de—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh,” she exclaimed, blushing hotly, “I can’t
read you that. Let’s see—”</p>

<p class='c003'>She leafed over the letter, one, two, three, four
sheets. Mrs. Blair was smiling.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Aren’t you leaving out the best parts?” she
asked archly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, there’s nothing,” Lavinia said, not looking
up. “But—oh, well, this is all. He says—</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘There is a good deal of unrest and uneasiness
here just now, because the first of May is coming.
The road is anticipating trouble with the freight
handlers; they may go out on a strike that day.’</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, dear,” sighed Lavinia, “more strikes, and
I suppose that means more trouble for Glenn.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, the strike of those men can’t affect him,”
Mrs. Blair assured her. “He’s a clerk now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, I know, but what if he gets the notion he
ought to help them by quitting too?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />THE TALK OF THE TOWN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Macochee’s common interest in Marley was
sharpened by his leaving town, and out of the
curiosity that raged, Lawrence and Mayme Carter
one evening made a call on Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, Lavinia,” said Lawrence, almost as soon
as they were seated in the parlor, “what’s the news
about Glenn? How’s he getting along?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, pretty well,” she said, smiling.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Does he like Chicago?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, yes; that is, fairly well.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Run get his letters and let us read them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, Jack! The idea!” Mayme rebuked him.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Lavinia instantly got up.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’ll read you part of one or two,” she
said. “He can tell you much better than I all
about himself.”</p>

<p class='c003'>She was gone from the room a moment and then
returned with two thick envelopes.</p>

<p class='c003'>“My, Lavinia, you don’t intend to read all that,
do you?” Lawrence made a burlesque of looking
at his watch.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, you needn’t be afraid,” said Lavinia, smiling.
She opened a letter.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here’s one that came several days ago. He
mentions you both in this one.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You don’t mean to say he connects our names?”
Lawrence affected consternation.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Can’t you be serious a moment?” Mayme said,
“I want to hear what he says; do go on, Lavinia,
and don’t mind Jack.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia read the extract from the diary and
Marley’s comment.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Doesn’t he say anything about you?” said
Lawrence. “Why don’t you read that? You skip
the most interesting parts. You’d better let me
read them. Here—” and he held out his hand
for the letter.</p>

<p class='c003'>But Lavinia laid one letter securely in her lap
and opened the other.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Listen to this,” she began, and then she glanced
over the first page and half-way down the second.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Here you’re skipping again,” cried Lawrence.
“Why don’t you play fair?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘I have made a friend,’ he says,” she began,
“‘and it all came about through the strike. You
know the freight handlers went out on the first of
May, and since then there has been more excitement
than work in the office. The freight house is stacked
high with freight, and only a few men are working
there and they are afraid of their lives. All
around the outside of the big, long shed are policemen
and detectives, and the strikers’ pickets. All
day they walk up and down, up and down, at a
safe distance, just off the company’s ground, and
they waylay everybody and try to get them not to
go to work here. I happened to see the strike
when it began. It was day before yesterday morning.
I had gone out in the freight house on some
little errand and just at ten o’clock I noticed a
man walk down by the platform that runs along
outside the shed. I saw him stop by one of the
big doors and look in. Suddenly he gave a low
whistle, then another. The men in the freight
house stopped and looked up. Then the man outside
raised his arm, and held up two fingers—’”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He wanted them to go swimming probably,” interrupted
Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Jack, do stop,” said Mayme, irritably.
“Right at the most interesting part, too! Do go
on, Lavinia.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia read on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘Then the man outside raised his arm, and held
up two fingers, and instantly every truck in the
shed dropped to the floor, bang, the men all went
and put on their coats, marched out of the freight
house—and the strike was on. Well, after that
came the policemen and the detectives and the
pickets, to say nothing of the reporters. It is about
these last that I mean to tell you, for among them
I have found this new friend. The other day a
young man came into the office to see Clark, our
boss. I was attracted by him at once. He was
tall, and his smooth-shaven face was refined and
thoughtful; I call him good-looking; his eyes were
dark and his nose straight and full of character;
his lips were thin and level; his hair was not quite
black and stopped just on the right side of being
curly. He was dressed modestly, but stylishly; I
remember he wore gloves—he always does—and I
thought him somewhat dudish. But what was my
pleasure to see on his waistcoat the little white cross
of my fraternity! I rushed up to him instantly,
and gave him the grip. He was a Sig., from an Indiana
college, and he is a reporter on the <em>Courier</em>.
His name is James Weston; no, he is no relation to
Bob Weston of Macochee at all. I asked him that
the first thing; but he is some relation to the
Cliffords, distant, I suppose.’”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I wonder if that isn’t the young man who
visited them summer before last?” asked Mayme.
“I’ll bet it is!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, it can’t be,” said Lavinia, “I thought of
that the very first thing, but you see he says,”
and Lavinia read on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘He says he hasn’t been there for years. We
chatted together for a few minutes and were friends
at once. To-morrow night, if I can get off in time,
I’m to dine with him at a café down-town. My,
but it was good to see some one wearing that little
white cross! You see my college training has
done me some good after all.’”</p>

<p class='c003'>In their conversation afterward, Lavinia and
Mayme celebrated Marley’s abilities as a writer,
but Lawrence begged Lavinia to read them more,
particularly, as he assured her, those parts about
herself, saying he could judge better of Marley’s
abilities after he heard how he treated romantic
subjects.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I want to know how he handles the love interest,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, you got that from George Halliday,” said
Mayme. “It sounds just like him when he’s discussing
some book none of us has read, doesn’t it,
Lavinia?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia admitted that it did sound like Halliday,
and Mayme returned to her attack on Lawrence
by saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“What do you know about writing, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c003'>They might have gone farther along this line
had not Mrs. Blair entered with a plate of cake
and some ice-cream that had been left over from
their dessert at supper. These refreshments instantly
seemed to affect Mayme with the idea that
the call had assumed the formality of a social
function, and as she nibbled at her cake, she asked
with a polite interest:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Just what is Mr. Marley’s position with the
railroad, Lavinia?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh,” Lavinia answered, “he has a place in the
office of the freight department; he’s a clerk there.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m so glad to know,” said Mayme, as if in
relief.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why?” Lavinia looked up in alarm.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, well, you know—how people talk.” Mayme
raised her pale eyebrows significantly. Lavinia
was disturbed, but Lawrence, detecting the danger,
instantly turned it off in a joke.</p>

<p class='c003'>“She heard he was a section hand,” he said.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The idea!” laughed Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Isn’t this just the worst place for gossip you
ever heard of?” said Mayme.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The worst ever,” said Lawrence. “If I were
you I’d quit and start a reform movement.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When they had gone and were strolling toward
the Carters’, Lawrence grumbled at Mayme:</p>

<p class='c003'>“What did you want to give it all away to Lavinia
for?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, Jack, I didn’t say anything, did I?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, no, nothing—only you tipped off the whole
thing to her.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, what did I say that hinted at it, even?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘Oh, you know how people talk!’” Lawrence
mimicked her tone as he repeated her words.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, you know they do, Jack, and you know
all the mean things they’ve been saying about
Glenn. And you remember Charlie Davis’ mother
told mama that Charlie ran across him in the street:
in Chicago and that—”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, Charlie Davis!” said Lawrence, as impatiently
as he could say anything. “What’s he?
Anyway, you didn’t have to tell Lavinia.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’m glad we got the truth anyway.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, so am I.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“We must tell everybody.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Sure,” acquiesced Lawrence, “if we can get the
gossips started the other way they’ll have him
president of the road in a few days.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />A MAN OF LETTERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The Macochee gossips, after they were assured
he was engaged in clerical, and not manual
work, might have promoted Marley much
more rapidly than his railroad would have done,
had it not been for the news that he had changed
his employment. They had gone far enough to
noise it about that Marley was chief clerk in the
office, where he was only a bill clerk, when the <em>Republican</em>,
with the impartial good nature with
which it treated all of Macochee’s folk, so long as
they kept out of politics, mentioned him for the
first time since his departure, and then, to tell of
the advancement he was rapidly making in the
metropolis that loomed so large and important
in their provincial eyes. Lavinia had the
facts in a letter from Marley a day or so before the
<em>Republican</em> had them, though she never could imagine,
as she told everybody, where the <em>Republican</em>
got its information.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I have a big piece of news to tell you,” he
wrote. “Last night I dined with Weston. It was
the first really enjoyable evening I have had since I
struck the town. Luckily, the strikers had everything
tied up so tight that we could do little work,
and I had no trouble in getting off in time. I met
him about six o’clock, and we went to the swellest
restaurant in town. Weston is the finest fellow
you ever saw; as it was pay night, he said he would
blow me off to a good dinner. And he did, the
best dinner I have ever eaten; there were half a
dozen courses, and as we ate we talked, talked
about everything, college days, the hard days that
come after college, and you, and everything. Weston’s
experience has been about the same as mine—one
long, hopeless search for a job. He, however,
did not wait so long as I did; he said that he realized
there was no place for him in a small town,
and so he set out for the city almost at once. His
father wanted him to study medicine, but he said
he hadn’t the money or the patience to wait, and he
hated medicine anyway, and, as newspaper work
offered the quickest channel to making a living he
chose that. His secret ambition, he confessed, is
literature, and I believe he is writing a book, but
he would not, or did not, tell me as much. He says
he thinks newspaper work a bad business for any
one to get into, but then I have discovered that
that is the way every man talks about his own
calling.</p>

<p class='c003'>“After we had finished our dinner, we sat there
for a long, long time over our coffee and cigarettes,
and we finally got to talking about the strike.
Weston, you know, has been working on it, and
I was glad to be able to tell him a good many things
he said he could use. Finally, I don’t know just
how it came about, but I told him how the strike
started with us, about the man appearing in the
street alongside the freight house, whistling, and
then holding up two fingers—I think I described it
to you in a letter the other night. Weston was
greatly interested; I can see him still, sitting across
the table from me, knocking the ashes from his
cigarette into his empty coffee-cup and looking so
intently at me out of his brown eyes that he almost
embarrassed me. And what was my surprise when
I finished to have him say:</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘By Jove, Marley, I’ll have to use that. I’ve
been wondering how to lead my story to-night.’</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now you know the strike at our place occurred
several days ago, but since then it has been spreading,
and to-day the men on another road walked
out. This morning when I picked up the <em>Courier</em>
and turned to the strike news, here is what I read,
under big head-lines:</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘A short man with a brown derby hat cocked
over his eye walked leisurely down Canal Street
at ten o’clock yesterday morning. The short man
walked a block and then turned and walked back.
At the open door of the C. and A.’s big freight
house he stopped. Suddenly he whistled, once,
twice, thrice, in low notes. Then he raised his hand
with a gesture that was graceful and yet commanding,
and held up two fingers. Inside the freight
house the men who were heaving away at the big
bales and boxes, attracted by the whistle, paused
in their labor and looked up; they saw the man
raise his two fingers; and, with the discipline of
well-trained troops, they dropped their trucks, put
on their coats and marched out of the freight
house. And the Alton had been added to the list
of railroads whose men were on strike.’</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course, I was surprised and puzzled, and a
little pleased too, that I had had a hand in the article.
As I read it, though, I thought of a hundred
details I might have told Weston, and I began to
wish I had written the account myself. This afternoon
he came around to the office again, and the
first thing he said was:</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘Did you see your story this morning?’</p>

<p class='c003'>“I told him I had, of course. ‘But,’ I added,
‘that was the way it happened on our road; not on
the Alton.’</p>

<p class='c003'>“But he only laughed, and said something about
the tricks of the trade.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And now for the news I was going to tell you.
I told Weston, as we talked the story over, of my
little wish that I had written the article myself, and
he looked at me intently for a moment. Then he
said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘How’d you like to break into newspaper business?’</p>

<p class='c003'>“My heart leaped; it came to me suddenly that
it wasn’t the law, nor railroad work, but journalism
that I wanted to enter. I told him so frankly
and he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“‘Well, it’s a dog’s life and I don’t know
whether I’m doing you a good turn or not, but
I’ll speak to the city editor tonight. He’s a little
short of men just now.</p>

<p class='c003'>“My heart is in my mouth. I can hardly wait
till to-morrow, when I’m to see him again. Think
of it, dear, and all it means! It means more money,
association with men of my own kind, men like
Weston, and a fine, interesting life; and it means
you; oh, it means you!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was able in this letter to communicate
to Lavinia some of his enthusiasm and some of
his suspense, and she found it difficult to await the
result of his next interview with Weston. She began
to count the hours until Marley and Weston
should meet again, and then in a flash it came over
her that they had doubtless already met, that the
decision was already known, the fate determined,
and she was still in ignorance. She had a sense of
mystery in it, and she grew impatient, wondering
why he did not telegraph. The next day came, and
a letter with it; but the letter did not decide anything.
Marley wrote that Weston had spoken to
the city editor, and that he had told him to bring
Marley around that evening. And so, other hours
of waiting, and then, at last, another letter. Marley
announced the result with what self-repression
he could command.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It’s settled,” he wrote. “I’m to go to work
Monday—as a reporter on the staff of the <em>Courier</em>.
The salary to begin with is to be fifteen dollars a
week. I’m glad to quit railroad work; I’m not
built to be a railroad man; I can’t adhere to rules
as they want me to, and I can’t bow down as it
seems I should. I didn’t tell you that my boss
and I had not been getting along very well lately;
I thought I wouldn’t worry you. I was glad to be
able to tell him to-day that I’d quit Saturday. I
did it in a proud and haughty manner; he seemed
surprised and shocked—even pained. And when I
broke the news gently to the young Canuck he expressed
great sorrow and regret, but in his secret
heart I knew he was glad, for now as a prophet he
can vindicate himself, at least partly, in his
diary.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia was glad that Marley had gone into
newspaper work; much as she had tried she had not
been able to conceive of him in exactly the ideal
light as a clerk in a railroad office; that position,
while it may have had its own promise, nevertheless
did not envelope him in the atmosphere she considered
native to him. In his new relation to literature,
which, in her ignorance, she confounded
with journalism, she felt a deep satisfaction, and a
new pride, and she was glad when the <em>Republican</em>
announced the fact of Marley’s new position; she
felt that it was a fitting vindication of her lover
in the eyes of the people of Macochee and a rebuke
for the distrust they had shown in him.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thereafter her mail was increased, for in addition
to his letter Marley sent her the <em>Courier</em> with
his work marked; often he marked Weston’s as
well, and early in June he wrote: “I want you to
read Weston’s story in Sunday’s paper about the
Derby; it’s a peach; it’s the best piece of frill
writing that the town has seen in many a day.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The tone of Marley’s letters now became more
cheerful; it was evident to Lavinia that he was
finding an interest in life, and in his descriptions
of his daily work and the places all over Chicago
it took him to and the people of all sorts it brought
him in contact with, she found a new interest for
her own life. When he wrote that his salary had
been increased because of his story about a Sunday
evening service in a church of the colored people
in Dearborn Street, it seemed to her that happiness
at last had come to them, and if, with the passing
of June, she felt a pang at Marley’s grieving in
one of his letters that this was the month in which
they had intended to be married, she was consoled
by the rapid progress he was making in his work.
His salary had been raised a second time; he was
receiving now twenty-five dollars a week; it seemed
large to her, and she could not understand why it
did not seem large to Marley, even when he wrote
that Weston was paid forty dollars a week.</p>

<p class='c003'>Her chief joy, perhaps, lay in the fact that he
seemed to be living more comfortably than he had
before. Now that he had left his dismal boarding-house
she found a relief from its subtly communicated
influence of the stranded wrecks of life, as
Marley surely found it in the apartments he was
sharing with Weston. She parted as gladly from
the knowledge of his landlady as Marley did himself,
assuring her that the landlady had “not decreased
any in value as a zoo exhibit since first I
rhapsodized about her.” Lavinia felt that she could
dispense with much of the worry her womanly
concern for his comfort had given her, and she
turned with a new joy to the books he was constantly
recommending.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Did you ever read,” he wrote, “Turgenieff’s
<em>Fathers and Sons</em>? I know that you didn’t and
therefore I know what a treat you have coming.
I’ll send you the book if you can’t get it in Macochee,
and I presume you can’t. Snider’s sign
‘Drugs and Books’ is a lure to deceive an unwary
public that doesn’t care as much for books as it
does for soda-water; and the stock there, as I recall
it, consists largely of forty-cent editions of
books on which the copyright has expired, and
which, printed on cheap, pulp paper, are to be introduced
for the first time to the natives of Macochee.
I wish you could see Weston’s little book-case,
with its rows of his favorites. Besides Turgenieff
and Tolstoi—he says the Russians are the greatest
novel writers the world has yet produced—he has
all of George Eliot; I have just read over again
<em>Middlemarch</em> and <em>Daniel Deronda</em>. He likes
Jane Austen, too, and he says you would like her;
I haven’t read any but <em>Emma</em> as yet. I’m going to
read them all. And if you like, you can read the
set of little volumes I am sending you to-day; we
can read them thus together. And Henry James—do
read him—<em>Daisy Miller</em> especially; you will
like that. Besides these, Weston has most of Ibsen’s
plays, and sometimes he reads parts of them
aloud to me; he reads them well. Some day, he
says, he’s going to write a play himself; he is fond
of the theater, and we often go. One of the fine
things about being on a newspaper is that we get
theater tickets, though we can’t always get tickets
to the theater we want. Now and then the dramatic
editor—a fine old fellow with a magnificent shock
of white hair, who may be seen about the office late
at night looking very <em>distingué</em> in his evening
clothes—gets Weston to write a criticism on some
play; and often the literary editor lets him review
books. Weston said to-day he’d get the literary
editor to let me review some books, and when I
told him I didn’t know how, he laughed in a
strange way and said that wouldn’t make the
slightest difference. There’s another book you <em>must</em>
read, and that is <em>A Modern Instance</em>. The chief
character is Bartley Hubbard, a newspaper man.
Weston and I had a big argument about the character
to-day. I said I thought it was a libel on the
newspaper profession and Weston laughed and
said it was only the truth, and that I’d agree with
him after I’d been in the work longer. ‘Newspaper
work isn’t a profession anyway,’ he said, ‘but a
business.’ He speaks of journalism—though he
won’t call it journalism, nor let me—just as lawyers
speak of the law. He is urging me, by the
way, to keep up my law studies, and I’m thinking
of going to the law school here, if I find I can
carry it on with my other work. Weston declares
I can; he says a man has to carry water on both
shoulders if he wants to amount to anything in
the world—Wade Powell said something like that
to me once. Weston says I’ll want to get out of
newspaper work after a while. He disturbed me
a little to-day, and he hurt me, too, by saying that
a newspaper man has no business to be married;
and he knows all about you, too. Of course, he
didn’t mean to hurt me, it’s merely his way of
looking at things.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Happy as she was, Lavinia still had to have her
woman’s worries, and they began to express themselves
in constant adjuration to Marley to guard his
health; she feared the effect of night work, and she
feared, too, that he could not carry on his law
studies and do his duty as a reporter at the same
time. She sympathized with the spirit of pride
and determination which made him wish to finish
his law studies and be admitted to the bar, but
she found a greater satisfaction in thinking of
him as a journalist than as a lawyer; the figure
he thus presented to her mind was so much more
romantic than the prosaic one of a lawyer to which
she had been all her life accustomed; on a large
metropolitan daily he was almost as romantic to her
as an army officer or a naval officer would have
been. And while she did not like the night work,
and had her fears of it for Marley, she nevertheless
felt strongly its picturesque quality.</p>

<p class='c003'>The picture Marley drew in one of his letters
of the strange shifting of the scene that is to be
observed in the streets of a great city as darkness
falls, when those that work in the prosaic day disappear
and in their places appears the vast and
mysterious army of the toilers by night, many of
them in callings demanding the cover of the night,
thrilled her strangely. But she did not know
how from all the temptations of the irregular life
he was leading he was saved, partly by the gentle
friend he had found in James Weston, but more
by the constant thought of the girl whom he had
left behind at home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br />HOME AGAIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley, after a year or more in Chicago, found
the excitement of his first return home growing
upon him as he looked out the car window and
long before the train entered the borders of Gordon
County he eagerly began watching for familiar
things.</p>

<p class='c003'>In the spirit of holiday which had come in this
his first vacation, he had felt justified in taking a
chair in the parlor car, though from the associations
he had formed in his newspaper work it was
more difficult now for him to resist than to yield
to extravagances. He had recalled with a smile
how in those first hard days in the freight office
he had joked about going home in a private car,
and he had had all day a childish pleasure in pretending
that the empty Pullman was a private
car; he could almost realize such a distinction
when he showed the conductor the pass his newspaper
had got for him.</p>

<p class='c003'>But even if he now felt glad that he was a newspaper
man instead of a railroad man, he was quite
willing to return to Macochee on any terms. He
had tried to convince himself that he knew the very
moment the train swept across the Indiana line into
Ohio, and he felt a fine glow of state pride.
He held his pride somewhat in check until he heard
some one speak a name that he recognized as that
of an Ohio town and then he boasted to the porter:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’m back in my own state again.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The porter, though ready to admit that Ohio was
a pretty good old state, was nevertheless not very
responsive, and Marley saw that he would have to
enjoy his sensations all alone.</p>

<p class='c003'>He could view with satisfaction the figure of a
tolerably well-dressed city man reflected in the long
mirror that swayed with the rushing of the heavy
coach. He knew that his return would create a
sensation in Macochee, though he was resolved to
be modest about it. Even if he was not returning
to Macochee in the ceremony he had dreamed of,
he was returning in a way that was distinguished
enough for him and for Macochee.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was eager to see the old town; he tried to
imagine his return in its proper order and sequence,
first, the little depot, blistering in the hot
sun of the August afternoon, the rails gleaming
in front of it, and the air above them trembling in
the heat; he could see the baggage trucks tilted
up on the platform; from the eating-house came the
odor of boiled ham compromised by the smell of
the grease frying on the scorching cinders that
were heaped about the ties; beyond was the grain elevator
that once appeared so monstrous in his
eyes; across the tracks, the weed-grown field; and
the only living things in sight the two men unloading
agricultural machines from a box-car abandoned
on a siding, the only sound, the ticking of a
telegraph instrument; the target was set, but the
station officials had not yet appeared.</p>

<p class='c003'>Thence, in thought, he went up Miami Street;
he saw the Court House and, lounging along the
stone base of the fence, the loafers whom no one
had ever seen move, but who yet must have made
some sort of imperceptible astronomical progress,
for they kept always just in the shadow of the
building; then the old law office across the way;
then Main Street, with its crazy signs, its awnings,
and the horses hitched to the racks, then the Square
with its old gabled buildings, the monument and
the cavalryman, the long street leading to his own
home, and at last, Ward Street, arched by its cottonwoods,—and
he recalled his unfinished verses
which had taken Ward Street for a subject:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I know a place all pastoral,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where streams in winter flow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And where down from the cottonwoods</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There falls a summer snow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c003'>And then, at last, the old house of the Blairs’
with its cool veranda, its dark bricks, its broad
overhanging cornices, and Lavinia standing in the
doorway!</p>

<p class='c003'>He had never forgotten the anguish of his parting
that night in spring, and he had looked forward
to this return as an experience that would
expiate it, and restore the lost balance of his life.
But now as he thought of his life in Chicago, of the
new scenes and associations, it came to him that
that night after all had been final; the youth who
had then gone forth had indeed gone forth never
to return; another being was coming back in his
stead. He had been successful in a way which at
first flattered his pride, but a new sense of proportion
had been growing in him that had lately made
him mistrust newspaper work; he had for it a dislike
almost as definite as that which used to displease
him in Weston. He was growing tired of his
life as a reporter; it had so many irregularities,
so many hardships; it detached him from wholesome,
every-day existence. He longed for some calling
more definite, more permanent, a work in
which he might do things, instead of record them
in an ephemeral way. He had for a while been envious
of Weston’s progress in his literary efforts,
and for a while he had emulated him, but he had
not been long in recognizing that he lacked literary
talent.</p>

<p class='c003'>Out of this dissatisfaction with himself he had
lately gone in earnestly to complete his law studies,
which all along he had pursued in a desultory
fashion. He found some consolation in the hope
that he might be admitted to the bar in the fall,
though how or when he was to get into a practice
was still as much of a problem as it had been in the
old days in Macochee. He clung steadfastly, however,
to the feeling that his newspaper work was
but a makeshift; Weston and he had constantly
supported each other in this view—it was their
one hope.</p>

<p class='c003'>With thoughts somewhat like these Marley had
been whiling away the hours of his long day’s
journey from Chicago to Macochee. He had read
thoroughly, and with a professionally critical
faculty, all the Chicago papers, and had long ago
thrown them aside in a disorderly pile. Now he
had the tired sense that his journey was nearing its
end.</p>

<p class='c003'>At last he saw the old mill-pond, and his heart
leaped in affection; then he got his umbrella and
sticks, took off his traveling cap and put it in his
bag. He stood up for the porter to brush him off,
and when he had selected a half-dollar as a tip, he
asked the porter to get his luggage together, and
in a conscious affectation he could not forego, began
to pull on his new gloves. They were nearing
Macochee now; and suddenly the tears started to
his eyes, as in a flash he saw his white-haired
father standing on the platform, anxiously craning
his neck for a first glimpse of the boy who was
coming home.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley’s mother did not reproach him when he
ate a hurried supper that evening and then set
off immediately for Lavinia’s. He renewed
some of the emotions of the earlier days of his
courtship as the familiar houses along the way
gradually presented themselves to his recognition;
he was glad to note the changeless aspect of a town
that never now could change, at least in the way of
progress, and he discovered a novel satisfaction—one
of the many experiences that were so rapidly
crowding in with his impressions—in the feeling
that here, at least, in Macochee, things would remain
as they were, and defy that inexorable law of
change which makes so many tragedies in life. Lavinia
must have recognized his step, for there she
was, standing in the doorway, a smile on her face,
and her eyelashes somehow moist. Marley felt
a strange discomposure; there was a little effort,
the intimacy of their letters must now give way to
the intimacy of personal contact. But in another
second she was in his arms, and her face was hidden
against his breast.</p>

<p class='c003'>“At last,” she said, “you’re here!”</p>

<p class='c003'>He felt her tremble, and he held her more
closely. When he released her she put her hands up
to his shoulders and held him away from her,
while she scanned him critically.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You’ve grown broader,” she said, “and heavier,
and—oh, so much handsomer!”</p>

<p class='c003'>The Blairs filed in presently, and Marley had
the curious sense of this very scene having been
enacted in his presence before, but it lacked the
usual baffling effect of this psychological experience,
for he was able to recall, in an incandescent
flash of memory, that it was almost a repetition of
their good-bys that night when he had gone away;
Mrs. Blair was as tender, and if Connie and Chad
were a little shy of his new importance, Judge Blair
was as dignified, and as anxious as ever to get back
to his reading. Marley felt once more that permanence
of things in Macochee; this household had
remained the same, and it made him feel more than
ever the change that had occurred in him.</p>

<p class='c003'>In lovers’ intense subjectivity, he and Lavinia
discussed this change seriously. They reviewed
their old dreams, and now they could laugh at
their defeated wish to live, even in an humble
way, in Macochee.</p>

<p class='c003'>“It was funny, wasn’t it?” said Marley. “I
was very young then,—nothing, in fact, but a kid.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Are you so very much older now?” asked
Lavinia with a slight hint of teasing in her tender
voice.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” Marley replied, with a seriousness that
impressed him, at least, as the ripe wisdom of
maturity, “I am not much older in years, but I am
in experience, and in knowledge of life. You see,
dear, you can measure time by the calendar, but
you can’t measure life that way. And Weston says
that there is no calling that will give a man experience
so quickly as newspaper work. You know
we see everything, and we get a smattering of all
kinds of knowledge. Weston says that is all that
reconciles him to the business; he says a man learns
more there than he ever does in college. He considers
the training invaluable; he says it will be of
great help to him in literature, if he can ever get
into literature—he isn’t sure yet that he can. He
can tell better after his book is published. And he
says a newspaper experience will help me in the
law, too, that is,” Marley added, with a whimsical
imitation of Weston’s despairing uncertainty, “if
I can ever get into the law.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You think a great deal of Mr. Weston, don’t
you?” said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He’s the finest fellow in the world, and the
best friend I ever had.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley had a curious intuition that Lavinia
was a little jealous of Weston. He immediately
sought to allay the feeling with this argument:</p>

<p class='c003'>“You see, when a man does all for a fellow that
Jim has done for me, and when you have lived
with him, and shared your haversack with him,
and he with you, like two soldier comrades, you
get right down to the bottom of him. And I want
you to know him, dear, I know you’ll like him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Lavinia was silent, and Marley had a fear that
she might not accept Weston quite so readily.</p>

<p class='c003'>“He has done me a world of good,” he went on.
“He has taught me much, he has corrected my reckoning
in more ways than one. He has taught me
much about books; and he has taught me to look
sanely on a life that isn’t, he says, always truthfully
reflected in books. And besides all, if it hadn’t
been for him, if he had not kept me at it and
urged me on, I think I should have been doomed
for ever to remain a poor newspaper man.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t you like newspaper work?” she asked
with a shade of disappointment in her tone.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I did, but I like it less every day. It’s a hard
and unsatisfactory life, and it has no promise in it.
A man very soon reaches its highest point, and
then he must be content to stay there. It’s the
easiest thing for a young fellow to get a start in,
if he’s bright; I suppose I’m making more money
than any of the young lawyers in Chicago; but because
it is so easy is the very reason why it is
hardly worth while. Things that are easily won
are not worth striving for.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And you’re going to get out of it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, as soon as I can. As soon as I can, I’m
going to get into the law. When Weston first began
urging me to keep up my studies, and when
finally he made me go to the night law school, I
consented chiefly because I had always felt the
chagrin of defeat in having been compelled to give
it up; lately, I’ve begun to see things differently,
and I’ve determined to carry out my first intention
and get into the law somehow. Of course,
it’s going to be hard. And one has to have a pull
there as everywhere else in these days.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was silent for a moment and, Lavinia
thought, a little depressed. She watched him sympathetically,
and yet she was a little troubled by
a sense of detachment. She felt that Weston was
now more closely associated with Marley’s struggle
than she, and she was disturbed, too, by the disappointment
of finding that his struggles were not
at all ended.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Weston says,” Marley went on presently, “that
newspaper work is a good stepping-stone, and by it
I may be able to arrange for some place in the
law which will give me the start I want.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I thought you liked your work,” Lavinia said;
“I thought you were happy in it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley detected her regret, and was on the point
of speaking, when Lavinia went on:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t see why you can’t go into literature as
well as Mr. Weston.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley laughed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“The reason is that I haven’t his talent,” he
said</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t see why,” Lavinia argued with some
resentment of his humility. “You haven’t enough
confidence in your own powers; you let Mr. Weston
dominate you too much.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Now, dearest,” he pleaded, “you mustn’t do
Jim that injustice. He doesn’t dominate me; but
he is so much wiser than I, he knows so much
more. You will understand when you meet him.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well,” she tentatively admitted, “that is no
reason why you shouldn’t in time be a literary man
as well as he. Why can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Because I can’t write, that’s why.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, Glenn, how can you say that? Your letters
disprove that. Every one who read them said
that they were remarkable, and that you should go
into literature. They said you had such good descriptive
powers.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley was looking at her in amazement.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Why, Lavinia, you didn’t show them!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“You simpleton!” she said, with a smile in her
eyes, “of course not; but I have read parts of
them to mama and to your mother now and then.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, well, that’s all right,” sighed Marley in
relief, and then he resumed his defense of Weston
and his analysis of himself.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Of course, I suppose I can write a fairly good
newspaper story; at least they say so at the office.”
He indulged a little look of pride, and then he
went on: “But that isn’t literature.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I don’t see why it isn’t,” she said. “I should
think it would be the most natural thing in the
world to go from one into the other.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Not at all. Literature requires style, personality,
distinction, and the artistic temperament.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’d say you were talking now like George
Halliday if I didn’t know you were talking like
Mr. Weston.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I wish you could hear Weston talk about literature,”
he said. “He’d convince you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“He couldn’t convince me that he can write any
better than you can.” Lavinia compressed her
lips in a defiant loyalty.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley paused to kiss the lips for their loyalty,
and he compromised the validity of his own argument
by saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“As a matter of fact, the law, in America and
in England, has given more men to literature
than journalism ever has.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Then maybe you can enter literature through
the law,” said Lavinia, seizing her advantage.</p>

<p class='c003'>“No,” said Marley, shaking his head. “I’m
not cut out for it, as Weston is. Some day he
will be a great man, and we shall be proud to
have known him so intimately. And we will have
him at our home; I have many a dream about
that.”</p>

<p class='c003'>He looked fondly at her, and her eyes brightened.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And there is another reason why I want to get
out of newspaper work,” he went on, speaking tenderly,
“and that is because everybody says a newspaper
man has no more right to be married than
a soldier has.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But they all are,” said Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, they all are, or most of them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“And I suppose it is the married ones who say
that.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I know one who is going to be married
just as soon as he can.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Who is that,—Mr. Weston?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“No, but Mr. Weston knows him, and knows his
intentions, and he has promised to be at the wedding
and act as best man.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, it would be fine to have a literary man at
the wedding, wouldn’t it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>They talked then about the wedding, and they
found all their old delicious joy in it. Marley
said it must be soon now, though with a pang that
laid a weight on his heart, he wondered, as he
thought of all the extravagances he had allowed
himself to drift into, where he was to get the
money. He could reassure himself only by telling
himself that he was going to live as an anchorite
when he got back to Chicago; even if he had to
give up the pleasant apartment with Weston and
go back to the boarding-house in Ohio Street.</p>

<p class='c003'>“How shall you like living in Chicago?” he
asked. “Can you be happy in a little flat, without
knowing anybody, and without being anybody?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I shall be happy anywhere with you, Glenn!”
she said, looking confidently into his eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <br />ILLUSIONS AND DISILLUSIONS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It was a pleasure to Marley to accept the homage
the people paid him; they confounded his
success in journalism with a success in literature,
and under the impression that all writers are somehow
witty, they laughed extravagantly at his lightest
observation.</p>

<p class='c003'>But much as Marley relished all this, much as
he enjoyed being at home again, with Lavinia and
with his father and mother, he was disturbed by
a certain restlessness that came over him after
he had been in Macochee a few days and the novelty
and excitement of his return had worn off. The
glamour the town had worn for him had left it;
it seemed to have withered and shrunk away. He
could no longer, by any effort of the imagination,
realize it as the place he had carried affectionately
in his heart during the long months of his absence;
its interests were so few and so petty, and he found
himself battling with a wish to get away. He was
fearful of this feeling; he did not dare to own
it to himself, much less to his father and mother
or to Lavinia.</p>

<p class='c003'>He was glad that Lavinia would not let him
mention going back to Chicago, and as the days
swept by with the swiftness of vacation time, he
was troubled that he did not feel more acutely the
sorrow he felt would best become the prospect of
another separation. He was comforted, finally,
when he was able to analyze his sensations sufficiently
to discover that it was neither his sweetheart
nor his parents that had changed, but his own
attitude toward life in a small town; he was vastly
relieved when he succeeded in separating his feelings
and saw that it was Macochee alone that he
had lost his affection for, though he could not
analyze his sensations deeply enough to recognize
himself as at that period of life when external
conditions are accepted for more than their real
value; he was still too young for that. And so he
could spend his days happily with Lavinia and
grudge the moments which Lawrence and Mayme
Carter filched from them by their calls, and he was
as resentful of Mayme’s invitation to the supper
which she exalted into a dinner with a reception
afterward, as was Lavinia herself.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Marley went to pay his call on Wade
Powell, he found many sensations as he glanced
about the dingy little office where he had begun his
studies. Wade Powell himself, smoking and reading
his Cincinnati paper, was sitting at his old
desk, with the same aspect of permanence he had
always given the impression of. Marley rushed in
on him with a face red and smiling and when
Powell looked up, he threw down his paper, and
leaped to his feet, saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’ll be damned!”</p>

<p class='c003'>But when their first greetings were over, Powell’s
manner changed; he began to show Marley a
certain respect, and he paid him the delicate tribute
of letting him do most of the talking, whereas
he used to do most of the talking himself. He was
not prepared to hear that Marley was still studying
law; and it cost him an effort to readjust his conception
of Marley as a successful journalist to the
old one of a struggling student. He gave Marley
some intelligence of this, and of his disappointment
when he said with a meekness Marley did not like
to see in him:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, of course, you know your own business
best.”</p>

<p class='c003'>But when Marley had taken pains to explain his
position and when he had described the Chicago
law offices, Powell grew more reconciled.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’ve watched you,” he said, “I’ve watched you,
and I’ve asked your father about you every time
I’ve seen him; my one regret was that you were
not working on a Cincinnati paper; then I could
have read what you were writing. I did try to get
a Chicago paper—but you know what this town is.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell was deeply interested in Marley’s description
of his old friend, Judge Johnson, and
as Marley gave him some notion of the judge’s
importance and prosperity Powell could only exclaim
from time to time:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’ll be damned!”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley did not tell Powell that Judge Johnson
had appeared to have forgotten him; he felt that
it would be more handsome to accept the moral
responsibility of a prevarication than to hurt Powell’s
feelings in the way he knew the truth would hurt
them. Even as it was, Judge Johnson’s success,
now so keenly realized by Powell when it had
been brought home to him in this personal way,
seemed to subdue him, and he was only lifted out
of his gloom when Marley said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“But I’ll tell you one thing, there isn’t a lawyer
in Chicago who can try a case with you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell’s eye brightened and his face glowed a
deeper red; then the look died away as he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I made a mistake. I ought to have gone
there.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Is it too late?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell thought a moment, and Marley regretted
having tempted him with an impossibility. He
was relieved when Powell shook his head and said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, it’s too late now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell, with something of the pathos of age
and failure that was stealing gradually over him,
begged Marley to come in and see him every day
while he was at home.</p>

<p class='c003'>“You see I’ve always kept your desk,” he said,
in a tone that apologized for a weakness he
perhaps thought unmanly, “just as it was when you
went away.”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley thought cynically that Powell had kept
everything else just as it was when he went away,
but he was instantly ashamed of the thought, and
ashamed, too, of the fact that he and Lavinia both
considered even this little morning call a waste of
time, and a sacrifice almost too great to be borne.</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell went with Marley out into the street,
and it gave him evident pride to walk by his side
down Main Street and around the Square.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I want them all to see you,” he said frankly.</p>

<p class='c003'>He made Marley go with him to the McBriar
House and then to Con’s Corner, and, in every
place where men stopped him and shook Marley’s
hand and asked him how he was getting along,
Powell took the responsibility of replying promptly:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Look at him; how does he seem to be getting
along?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Powell found a delight that must have been
keener than Marley’s in Marley’s fidelity to Chicago,
expressed quite in the boastful frankness
of the citizens of that city when abroad, though to
Marley it seemed that he was putting it on them by
doing so. He found them all, however, in a spirit
of loyalty to Macochee that might easily have
become combative.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, little old Macochee’s good enough for us,
eh, Wade?” they would say.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley would not let them be ahead of him in
praise of Macochee, and Powell himself softened
enough to admit that old Ohio was a pretty good
place to have come from.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they suddenly encountered Carman in the
street, Marley flushed with confusion, first for
himself and then vicariously for Powell. But
there was no escape from a situation that no doubt
exaggerated itself to his sensitiveness, and he was
soon allowing Carman to hold his hand in his
right palm while with the other Carman solicitously
held Marley’s left elbow, and transfixed him
with that left eye which still refused to react to
light and shade.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, how are you?” asked Carman. “How
are you, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, I’m all right.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Guess you’re glad now I didn’t give you that
job, eh?”</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley could not look at Powell, but he hastened
to say:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, I’m glad, now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Maybe it was for the best,” said Carman.</p>

<p class='c003'>When they had left him Marley quickly and
crudely tried to change the subject, but Powell
insisted on saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“I want you to know that I’ve always felt like
a dog over that.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Oh, don’t mention it,” Marley begged. “I
was honest when I told Carman I was glad it
turned out as it did.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” said Powell, “I guess it was all for the
best.”</p>

<p class='c003'>To Marley’s relief they dropped the matter then,
and went over to Con’s Corner. There Powell
lighted a cigar, and Marley could not resist asking
for a brand of cigarettes, the kind that Weston
smoked, though he knew that Con would not have
them. He felt mean about it afterward, but he
could not forego some of the petty distinctions of
living in a city and he indulged a little revenge
toward the people who had deserted him in what
had seemed to him his need, and now, in what
seemed to them his prosperity, were so ready to
rally to him. Marley went home at noon feeling
that his triumph had been almost as great as if
he had come home in a private car.</p>

<p class='c003'>His triumph soon was at an end; they came to
the afternoon of the day when Marley was to return
to Chicago. It was a golden day, with a sun
shining out of a sky without clouds, and yet a
delicious breeze blew out of the little hills. Marley
and Lavinia walked out the white and dusty
pike that made the road to Mingo. They walked
slowly along the edge of the road, in silence,
under the sadness of the parting that was before
them. They longed ineffably that the moments
might be stayed; somehow they felt they might be
stayed by their silence.</p>

<p class='c003'>But when they had ascended the hill and stood
beside the old oak-tree which grew by the road,
they looked out across the valley of the Mad River,
miles and miles away—across fields now golden
with the wheat, or green with the rustling corn
that glinted in the sun, off and away to the trees
that became vague and dim in the hazy distance.
Back whence they had come lay Macochee; they
could see the tower of the Court House, the red
spire of the Methodist church, the gleam of the sun
on some great window in the roof of the car-shops;
on the other side of town crawled a train, trailing
its smoke behind it. Marley looked at Lavinia—she
was leaning against the tree, and as he looked
he saw that her blue eyes were filling slowly with
tears.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Isn’t it beautiful!” he said, looking away from
her to the simple scenery of Ohio.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Do you remember that day?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“When we picked out our farm—where was it?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Wasn’t it over there?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” he said. “We could come and live here
when we are old.” He knew he was but seeking to
console himself for what now could not be.
“And there is the old town,” he said. “It looks
beautiful from here, nestling among those trees,
it seems peaceful, and calm, and simple. But it is
different when you are in it; for there are gossip
and envy and spite, and I can never quite forgive
it because it had no place for me. Well,” he went
on defiantly, in the relief he had been able to make
for himself out of his immature reading of Macochee’s
character; “I don’t need it any more; it is
little and narrow and provincial, and the real life
is to be lived out in the larger world. It’s a hard
fight, but it’s worth it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t you regret leaving it?” asked Lavinia,
in a voice that was tenderer than Marley had ever
known it. Marley looked at Macochee and then he
looked at her.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I regret leaving it, dear heart, because I must
leave you behind in it.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Would you never care to come back if it were
not for me?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I might,” he admitted, “when we are old. We
could come back here then and settle down on our
farm over there.” He pointed.</p>

<p class='c003'>“I’m half-afraid of the city,” Lavinia said.</p>

<p class='c003'>He turned and took her in his arms.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Dearest,” he said, “you must not say that;
for the next time I come it will be to take you
away from Macochee.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Will it?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes; and it can’t be long now. How we have
had to wait!”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” she repeated, “how we have had to wait!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXXII<br /> <br />AT LAST</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Marley, in that compensatory pleasure we
find in difficulties in the retrospect, was afterward
fond of saying that if he had waited until
he had the money and the position to warrant
his marrying, he never would have married at
all.</p>

<p class='c003'>Just what moved him to take the decisive step
he did he would have found it hard to tell. He
had grown accustomed to the life he was living in
Chicago, he had succumbed, as it were, to his environment;
he no longer regretted Macochee and
he found a satisfaction in declaring, whenever he
had the chance, that the kindest thing the town had
ever done for him was to refuse him a place within
its borders. As he looked back at all the plans he
had formed, he marveled at their number, but he
marveled more that he should have had such regret
in the failure of all of them; he was glad
now that they had failed; had any one of them succeeded
his life would have been diverted into other
channels, and it gave him a kind of fear when he
tried to imagine his life in those other channels;
he could see himself in those relations only as some
other identity, and it gave him a gruesome feeling
to do this.</p>

<p class='c003'>Not that he was satisfied with himself or his
surroundings; he did not like newspaper work, and
he did not like Chicago very well. He was determined
to get out of newspaper work at any rate,
and while he could not yet clearly see a way of getting
into the law, he had a calm assurance that he
would do it, in the end. Weston sustained him in
this hope by saying:</p>

<p class='c003'>“A man can’t control circumstances; they control
him; but sometimes he can dodge them, and,
after all, every sincere prayer is answered.”</p>

<p class='c003'>During the winter that followed the summer
when he had paid his visit to his home he worked
hard at the law, spending in study the hours the
other men on his newspaper spent in their
dissipations, and in the spring he stole away almost
secretly to Springfield, took the examination, and
was admitted to the bar.</p>

<p class='c003'>After it was done, it seemed but a little thing;
he wrote Lavinia and he wrote Wade Powell, knowing
the interest Powell would have in the fact, that
he felt no different now as a lawyer than he had
when he was merely a layman. Weston had spent
the winter over the book he was writing; in the
spring he found a publisher, and <em>The Clutch of
Circumstance</em> was given to the world. Marley
thought it a wonderful book, and so did Lavinia,
and while it made but little noise in the world,
Weston said it had done better than he expected—so
well, in fact, that he was going to give up newspaper
work, and give his attention wholly to writing
another book.</p>

<p class='c003'>It was a shock to Marley when Weston told him
they would have to give up their apartment; it was
a break in the life to which he had grown accustomed.
But it seemed a time of change, and it
was then he wrote Lavinia that he thought it useless
for them to wait any longer; he thought they might
as well be married then as at any time.</p>

<p class='c003'>Unconsciously, perhaps, he wrote this letter as if
he and not she had been waiting, and if he had
known the state of the sensitive public opinion in
Macochee, he might have felt himself justified in
the attitude. Ever since his visit there the summer
before his apparent prosperity had given the sentiment
of the town an impetus in his favor; the
people had turned their criticism toward Lavinia;
for months it was a common expression that it was
a shame she was keeping Marley waiting so long.
They would nod in a sinister way, and insinuate
the worldliest of motives; it was generally under
stood that she was waiting for Marley to make a
fortune, and this, they held, was demanding too
much. She had withdrawn utterly from the society
of Macochee; and she had not gone to one
of the balls Lawrence had arranged that winter at
the Odd Fellows’ Hall; her position, outwardly
at least, was as isolated as that of the Misses Cramer,
the fragile and transparent old maids who
lived so many years in their house sheltered by the
row of cedars behind the High School grounds.</p>

<p class='c003'>When Judge Blair received the formal letter in
which Marley told him he had asked Lavinia to
name the day and requested his approval, the judge
gave his consent with a promptness that surprised
him almost as much as it did Mrs. Blair and Lavinia.
He justified his inconsistency to his wife,
in order perhaps, the more thoroughly to justify it
to himself, by saying that he had long felt Lavinia’s
position keenly.</p>

<p class='c003'>“If the strain has been to her anything like
what it has been to me,” he said to his wife, “they
could not have endured it much longer.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“It will be lonely here without her,” said
Mrs. Blair, pensively.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes,” the judge assented, and then after a moment’s
thought he added:</p>

<p class='c003'>“But we can now begin to worry about Connie.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t you dare mention that, William!” said
Mrs. Blair, almost viciously. “She mustn’t begin
to think of such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“But she’s in long dresses now, and she seems
to walk home more and more slowly every night
with those boys from the High School.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I don’t propose to go through such an
experience as we have had for these last three
years, not right away, at any rate.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge tried to laugh, as he said:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’ll turn Connie over to you; I’m going
to have a little peace now.”</p>

<p class='c003'>The judge complained that he could find no
peace, however, anywhere, so great was the preparation
that raged thereafter in the house, driving
him with his book and cigar from place to place.
Mrs. Blair and Lavinia and Connie were in fine
excitement over the gowns that were being fashioned,
and Miss Ryan lived at the Blairs’ for
weeks, while in every room there were billowy
clouds of white garments, and threads and ravelings
over all the floors.</p>

<p class='c003'>Meanwhile it was understood that Marley, too,
was making arrangements in Chicago. He had
leased a small flat on the South Side, and had arranged
with Weston to remove most of the furniture
of their apartment into the new home where
the lovers were to set up housekeeping. Mrs.
Marley was to spare them some of the things from
her home, and Mrs. Blair, from time to time, designated
certain articles which she was willing to devote
to the cause. Chad’s contribution was merely
a suggestion; he said they could depend on the wedding
presents to fill up the gaps.</p>

<p class='c003'>They were married in the middle of June. The
ceremony was pronounced by Doctor Marley in
the parlor of the Blair home; everybody bore up
well until, under the stress of his emotion, the
doctor’s voice broke, and then Mrs. Blair wept and
the judge wiped his eyes and his reddened, anguished
face. Mrs. Marley cried too, though every
one tried to comfort her with the assurance that
she was not losing a son, but gaining a daughter.
Connie, in her first long gown, acted as maid
for her sister, but it was evident that she was
desperately impressed by the young author of <em>The
Clutch of Circumstance</em>, who had come on from
Chicago to act as groomsman.</p>

<p class='c003'>The company that had been invited was as
much impressed by Weston as Connie was;
they had never had an author in Macochee before,
and though most of them had such confused notions
of Weston’s performances in literature that
they grew cold with fear when they talked with
him, they nevertheless braved it out for the sake of
an experience they could boast of afterward. Most
of them took refuge in a discussion of Marley’s
achievements with him, and they gave him the
unflattering impression that Marley’s work was as
important as his own.</p>

<p class='c003'>Many of them had plots they wished him to use
in his stories, others wished to know if he
took his characters from real life; and Mrs. Carter
was of such an acuteness that she identified
Marley as his hero, though Weston had tried to
keep his book from having any hero. George
Halliday, however, was able to save the day; he
could discriminate; he had read <em>The Clutch of
Circumstance</em>, having borrowed Lavinia’s autograph
copy, and he told Weston that while he did
not go in for realism, because it was too photographic,
too materialistic and lacked personality,
he nevertheless had enjoyed a pleasant half-hour
with the volume, and considered it not half-bad.</p>

<p class='c003'>This conversation was held in plain hearing of
all in that difficult moment after the ceremony,
when the relatives of the bride had solemnly kissed
her, and her most intimate friends, like Mayme
Carter, had wept on her neck. The people were
standing helplessly about; Marley noticed Wade
Powell, as dignified as a clergyman, in his black
garments and white tie standing apart with his
wife.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley had never seen Mrs. Powell before, but
he recalled in a flash that she filled his conception
of her; and this delicate, sensitive little face
completed the picture he remembered long ago to
have formed. When he saw Powell standing there,
his hands behind him, unequal to the ordeal of
being entertained in Judge Blair’s house, bowing
stiffly and forcing a smile on the few occasions when
he was spoken to or thought he was being spoken
to, he had a wish to go to him, but he could not
then leave his place by Lavinia’s side. He was glad
a moment later when he saw his father and Wade
Powell in conversation, and as he and Lavinia
passed them on their way out to the dining-room
he heard his father say:</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, I’ll tell you, Mr. Powell, when I was
young my creed was founded on the fact of sin in
man; but now that I am old, I find it more and
more founded on the fact of the good that is in all
of them.”</p>

<p class='c003'>When the supper was over, Lawrence gave the
cheer that every one wished to see come to the
wedding by clearing the parlor for a dance, and
Marley was glad that his position now permitted
him to refrain from dancing with a valid excuse.</p>

<p class='c003'>Marley thought that Lavinia never looked so
pretty as she did when she stood at the head of
the stairs after she had donned her blue traveling
gown, drawing on her gloves and waiting for the
carriage that was to drive them to the station.
Her face was rosy in the light that filled the house,
and she met his eyes with a fond, contented glance.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Are you happy?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c003'>“Don’t you see?” she said, looking up at him.</p>

<p class='c003'>“And will you be happy in that big city, away
from every one you know, as the wife of a newspaper
man?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“I shall be happy anywhere with you.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Our dreams are coming true,” Marley said,
“after a fashion. And yet not just as we dreamed
them, after all.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“In all the essentials they are, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, but you know our dream was that I was to
practise law.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Well, we still have that dream.”</p>

<p class='c003'>“Yes, we still have it; maybe it will come true.
Weston says that our dreams are as much realities
in our lives as anything else.”</p>

<div class='c006'>THE END</div>
